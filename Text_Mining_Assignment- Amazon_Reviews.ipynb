       "'This product so far has not disappointed. My children love to use it and I like the ability to monitor control what content they see with ease. great for beginner or experienced person. Bought as a gift and she loves it Inexpensive tablet for him to use and learn on, step up from the NABI. He was thrilled with it, learn how to Skype on it already... I\\'ve had my Fire HD 8 two weeks now and I love it. This tablet is a great value.We are Prime Members and that is where this tablet SHINES. I love being able to easily access all of the Prime content as well as movies you can download and watch laterThis has a 1280/800 screen which has some really nice look to it its nice and crisp and very bright infact it is brighter then the ipad pro costing $900 base model. The build on this fire is INSANELY AWESOME running at only 7.7mm thick and the smooth glossy feel on the back it is really amazing to hold its like the futuristic tab in ur hands. I bought this for my grand daughter when she comes over to visit. I set it up with her as the user, entered her age and name and now Amazon makes sure that she only accesses sites and content that are appropriate to her age. Simple to do and she loves the capabilities. I also bought and installed a 64gig SD card which gives this little tablet plenty of storage. For the price I think this tablet is best one out there. You can spend hundreds of dollars more for additional speed and capacity but when it comes to the basics this tablets does everything that most people will ever need at a fraction of the cost. This amazon fire 8 inch tablet is the perfect size. I purchased it for my husband so that he has a bigger screen than just his phone. He had gotten me one a few years ago so I knew it would be a good purchase. Great for e-reading on the go, nice and light weight, and for the price point given, definitely worth the purchase. I gave this as a Christmas gift to my inlaws, husband and uncle. They loved it and how easy they are to use with fantastic features! Great as a device to read books. I like that it links with my borrowed library e-books. Switched from another popular tablet brand and I am happy with the choice I made. It took some time to get books from my previous non-Kindle reader, but finally figured out a way! I love ordering books and reading them with the reader. Not easy for elderly users cease of ads that pop up. Excellent product. Easy to use, large screen makes watching movies and reading easier. Wanted my father to have his first tablet and this is a very good value. He can watch movies and play a few games. Easy enough for him to use. Simply does everything I need. Thank youAnd silk works wonders Got it as a present and love the size of the screen The kindle is easiest to use, graphics and screen crisp, clear, brilliant colors. nice reader. almost perfect for what i want/need. good bargain I really like this tablet. I would have given 5 stars but sometimes you have to push start several times after you unlock the screen and it is a little annoying. Great video quality lots of fun apps fun for the whole family Love love love my kindle fire 8.....this is what my 9 yr old granddaughter said when I bought this for her at Christmas..we have purchased kindled in the past but this one has been the best....love the fact that you can now use a memory card in it...that helps so much when you use it for books...games...music and viedos...thanks Excellent tablet with nice screen. I wish Amazon would pre install the play store, this would have been perfect. Preloaded with the reading app from Kindle but expandable with other apps. Perfect for travel. Carry your library, games and productivity apps in a small footprint. Very happy with this product and easy to use..picture is clear, takes great pictures.. My grandchildren are home schooled and utilize the tables for many learning apps! They LOVE using them as it makes them feel \"so grown up\"! The tablets are a great leaning tool and they are receiving many benefits from them! Great size, easy to carry for traveling. Need to spend more time Looking into apps for contact manegement, interactive calenders and most important, music storage and use. I purchased this when my last tablet died. It meets all basic needs and the price was great. Perfect for downloading and reading books !! Perfect size and has a nice, bright screen. I was surprised when I learned of the capabilities of this device. Now my husband has more access to his desktop and I am doing things which I couldn\\'t on his device. I got it for my son. Its user friendly and durable. The visual quality on the Fire 8 HD is amazing. It runs very fast and is easy to use, very durable. If your looking for a affordable gift this is it!. This is a great tablet for the price, would recommend it to anyone looking for a basic tablet. Works great. Love the portability of books. Overall great product I am still learning all the things I can do with my new Kindle Fire. It is so much better (lighter in weight and easier to use) than my old tablet. Just the right size for reading books and playing some games. I love everything about this tablet! The imaging is sharp and clear. It\\'s fast and light weight. Love it! Overall a nice product for traveling purposes Value for money My children love this table great quality of pictures, excellent camera I bought 3 tablets and my family was not disappointed. Great tablet fast screen good size never gives me problem Bought this for my 87 year old grandmother who wanted to be able to play games and read books from the library. My aunt lives with her and can help her use it so its perfect for that type of user. After playing with It, I would consider it for just about anyone other than a hardcore user that wants the latest and greatest tech. if you are tech saavy, you can do more with these Fire tablets than advertised. This is exactly what the person wanted as a gift and she enjoys using it. Does all basic functions of a tablet. Hardcore users may want an iPad. Works great for a simple tablet. Not a huge fan of the silk browser but it could be worse! I am very happy with my purchase! It\\'s fast and easy to use. This is my second kindle fire . More flexibility than a Kindle and bigger screen. Like it because I can surf the web and download and read books. For the money you cannot beat this tablet. Full of features, picture quality is great, and very fast speed while using the internet. Easy to use, solid build, sharp HP screen for movies. Who needs more? Tablet is perfect for beginners who just want basic this is my first tablet .. love it .. actually read my first e-book on it .. large screen, easy to read & play games .. fits nicely in my purse This 8 inch Fire is definitely better than the cheaper 7 inch. It works fine enough for teens to play games and watch movies. Great tablet for under $100. Does not have the highest specs, but gets the job done for lite tablet users. I purchased the kindle fire because I needed a entertainment only device for long flights. This device is the perfect size for travel and easy to use and set up with your Amazon account. It is worth purchasing a Fire tablet if you are an Amazon Prime member. If not, I would not recommend it because the available apps are limited . My only complaint about this device is that if it freezes it is difficult to reset. This fire tablet has long battery life. Reasonable fast Got this for my wife and she loves it. She had the previous generation and this one is a giant keep forward. Sleek packaging easy set up and great for anyone who wants a e reader with more to offer. Best and most affordable option of all the Kindle devices available. I did not want to get a new kindle but my old one would not charge or show a charge anymore. I could not depend on it for any length of time so I finally broke down and bought a new one. I am very happy with this one. I was afraid I would lose my music and photos since not all came from the Amazon store. However, everything I had on the old kindle transferred to the new one. I am still learning all about it but so far so good. My daughter likes this tablet to play her online games! Easy to figure out and used it extensively on my vacation. Excellent tablet to leave at my easel and display reference photos. It\\'s light enough to velcro to a articulating stand (so I can position the tablet right next to my canvas). It\\'s cheap enough to not worry about. I love it, for the price. I bought this wanting for books comics and movies and it has not disappoint ever since My 4 year old Grandson loves his Kindle. He had to have one after his sister got one. Easy to use. As a beginner I found this pad very good. Enjoy the kindle app. This Kindle does what I need it to do. The camera could be better but overall I am pretty happy with my purchase. Purchased this for my daughter to do more reading. It has so much more options for her if she wants. this is a great tablet for the price. my kid loves it ,does alot reading on it. I was really hoping that this would be faster than some other inexspensive tablets I\\'ve had. I mainly use it for email though and it does the job. Bought as a Christmas gift for someone. I bought iPad as well. Will update when it\\'s used. Great tablet for the price. It is easy to navigate. I believe that this will be very useful during my husbands recovery from foot surgery. This is something that is useful if your looking for something to take along trips This is a wonderful device. I love the extra capabilities and apps. Decent tablet. Access to kindle and pretty much all your google apps. I am very happy with this tablet. The worst thing is that my steals it all the time. Lol A family member has vision problems. They had seen/used the Kindle of another family member - especially the ability to scale text. This device will make it possible to read, which she has had extreme difficulty doing. Easy setup and connect to WIFI. Great viewing area. Easy to read in bright places. I got this fire for my friend who wants to buy kindle..this serves both Kindle and Tab... very nice and very cheap..worth for what i paid.. I highly recommend this for beginners Really enjoyed the price value of this tablet versus ipad Amazing tablet with fast processor. It looks great... got good deal We got this for our 5 year old and this is really great for the price. Works like a charm!! I find it easy to use, but the kindle does not come with instructions, so you have to find your way around. I bought this because I was tired of watching Youtube and Twitch on my phone. Excellent display sound is decent-not great but you can always buy a speaker. The negatives are-it is definitely a fingerprint magnet, and the Spectrum TV app is AWFUL-the app works fine on my phone, but for some reason on this tablet it freezes and is unusable. All things considered, for 65 bucks it\\'s hard to be beat. I love this tablet. The battery life last a long time. I use my Amazon Kindle Fire predominately for watching movies on Amazon Prime, Netflix\\'s, and checking my emails. I also carry it to my appointments and meetings. It is a compact tablet, and not big and bulky. The playback of the movies are great, and the movies are HD. Great little tablet if you are looking for something to watch movies and checking emails. I would definitely recommend this tablet to friends and family members. My daughter loves this kindle, she does so much with it,well worth the money. Was looking for a tablet that was highly portable & could run my DIRECTTV app & stream videos. (Other electronics I have are much older versions). Salesman recommended this model to me based on personal experience. I am still learning all its functions but so far it seems easy to use & is doing what it promised to do. This is my second Fire, the other one is now retired. I like having HD. Works just fine. My wife bought this for me for my birthday. I enjoy reading biographys which usually have color photos. The regular Kindle make the pics black and white or they\\'re aren\\'t any. This allows me to see the color photos. I also love the night feature when I\\'m in bed reading. I no longer need a light on to read or need to hold a large book. Thanks to a knowledgeable, low-pressure salesperson, I was ready to buy my first tablet. This one was the right price (on sale) and I have not been disappointed. Every few days I learn more ways to use it besides checking e-mails & checking out library books & audio books. It stays charged for days, even with regular use. I recommend it as an inexpensive and very satisfactory alternative to more expensive tablets. It\\'s a great tablet for the price. Don\\'t expect it to be as fast more expensive ones. It\\'s meant for casual use and it does a great job at that. For the price, you can\\'t beat it. Get a nice large microsd card and you don\\'t have to worry about space. It runs a little slow on certain things if you are multitasking but it\\'s a simple tablet. I\\'ve run plenty of 720p videos without fail. It\\'s great for ebooks or other files. Some more elaborate pdfs take a while to load if they have a lol of graphics. Battery life seems good for a small table too.The only real Issue I have is the Amazon App store being limited. It is an offshoot of Android but not all the same apps are available. There is a way around it but I wish they would just allow it access to Google Play or at least offer the same apps.So, it\\'s a nice inexpensive table that works great. For the money, you will love it but don\\'t get upset that is doesn\\'t run as fast as a $500 tablet. That\\'s not its job. Bought it for my 10 yr old granddaughter. Does everything she wants it to do in a tablet. Very easy to use tablet. Lots of apps and game available. We love the FreeTime settings for kids on the newer Kindle Fires. I was able to create a login for each of our kids as well as myself and set limits to the amount of device time they are allowed daily (can set to more for weekends if desired). You can set the age restrictions for content also, to avoid inappropriate ads, etc. Once you\\'ve downloaded apps, you can choose which ones you want each child to have access to in their profile settings, so if one child is older you can allow them access to something their younger siblings shouldn\\'t have. Basically, I like that I can set their access rights and know they\\'re safe so I don\\'t have to continually monitor every moment. By the way, FreeTime kids settings are available without having to subscribe to their FreeTime app access plan. :) Great tablet, very clear picture. Would buy again. Good reader which is why I bought it. Ads are annoying. It\\'s a mini computer packed in a handheld devise. Applications load quickly and I am able to get my work completed, while riding the commuter rail. Nice for a smaller tablet. It\\'s good for Internet surfing. Purchased as a door prize gift given with a one year Amazon membership. The recipient loves it and says it performs very well. (As a past Amazon Fire user, now i-Pad graduate, I loved my Amazon Fire for more than 4 years without any problems. In fact, I just recycled it on to my son and it runs like a champ). I have 4 other kinds of tables. This the best I have had. I can listen to music, read a book, listen to a book, or watch movies/tv shows. Great product for the kids gaming apps parental controls to make sure you can monitor kids and prevent unwanted app purchases I purchased 2 of these tablets for my 6 and 8 year old. They were a Black Friday special for $59. They are perfect for the apps and games they wanted. Great product. Love the Amazon ecosystem. The Freetime subscription is a must Needed something a bit larger than the 6+ to stream Netflix, this was perfect! my husband bought this for me as a Christmas present. I couldn\\'t understand why he bought it because I already have a Kindle Fire.Once I opened it and got it going, I loved all it could do plus the graphic is so much colorful than my older Kindle. my grandson-8-loves this --the games and the books! Great product and I\\'m very satisfied with it. I recommend it to other people. I purchased this tablet for my niece for Christmas and she love it. Easy to use, responds quickly, great screen brightness. Great tablet but apps limited comparison of other tablets. Works as we thought it should. NO PROBLEMS. Good buying experience. We have the smaller one, and been great. This one is even better, because of the size. I am a prime member & I love this tablet. Very user friendly especially if you are a prime member with amazon. Not real tech savvy so I need all the help I can get to keep things simple & automatic. Great clarity of picture/data. Have a 10\" tablet and wasn\\'t sure about downgrading size (old eyes) but was delighted to see it works fine at 8\" instead of 10\". Also, easier to take around in the smaller size. Highly recommend especially if you subscribe to Amazon and are a prime member. Great benefits!! Got this for my wife. She loves the bigger screen and the better app management features that this one has over her earlier generation kindle. Definitely worth it! Connects to home WiFi automatically. Many books, and many games. Actually functions like a computer tablet. E-mail is a breeze. Bought this to replace no-name budget tablet for my daughter. She loves this as it is much faster and has a better display than her old tablet. This is a wonderful value as it is faster, has a better display and sound, is a name brand and cost about the same ... what\\'s not to love about this product? She loves this tablet. It works well unlike her \"bargain\" tablet which she tried to use previously and cost about the same. She likes the sound of it also! She enjoys the free games she downloaded and navigates the wev easily with it. It\\'s no iPad, but it\\'s great for Netflix and some app games. I\\'m not worried about the kids getting their paws on it since it\\'s relatively inexpensive. Didn\\'t have some of the features I was looking for. Returned it the next day. May be good for others I bought this for my daughter and she loves it. It\\'s speedy when loading books! Purchased for my wife who reads a lot and truly enjoys the amazon fire. A great Christmas gift, the kids love the gifts... Daughter got this as a present. It was easy to set up and display is great. Features allow us to limit her time on games, web, etc. while allowing her unlimited time to read I have enjoyed just learning how to use it. You\\'re never too old to learn new things. bought for husband and he was surprised it does the work he needs it for This was a birthday present and it was ideal for a traveler to read ebooks on while on the rood My teenage daughter enjoyed her three year old 7\" Kindle for recreation but wanted a larger screen for word processing. Paired this with a Bluetooth keyboard and she was thrilled. i Bought this around black friday for $60 hoping it would be awesome... it failed so hard i tried multiple different micro SD cards none of which were recognized and YES i formated them with every format i could think of ... Fat32, NTFS, Fat, Xfat... i even tried to have the tablet do it... didnt work... to make matters worse half the apps i wanted to use werent in the app store and i came to find out that it isnt linked to the normal google play store this tablet has its own app store which is missing many common apps... the main reason i bought this was to play clash of clans and i cant because it wasnt on the app store... i tried to also use aftermarket play stores to play COC but it didnt work... launched and played 1 time but didnt work or update after that... needless to say i returned it and bought a $250 samsung galaxy tab A 10.1 (2016 version) with S-pen and its WAYYYYY better... bottom line you get what you pay for... also hint the s-pen version has an extra 1 GB of ram over the non pen version... so you should get that if you can afford the extra $50... The People I purchased this for during Christmas Holiday LOVED IT... I purchased two of these for my kids, ages 12 and 10. Forget the IPod touch. For the price, this tablet can\\'t be beat! They can download games, books and movies for free all included with my Amazon Prime membership. Awesome!! my kids enjoy the Fire HD and they love the picture quality Bought two of these tablets for my nieces for Christmas after we had originally bought the Amazon fire 7 inch which had a virus after 3 days of purchase and was unable to work good thing we played with it prior to giving as gift do to this being said I was very surprised on how well this tablet has held up to to not so careful 8 years olds playing with it daily we have had no problems screen is big enough for little hands to maneuver and see on was the highlight of there Christmas and still is would definitely recommend it Really like the updates this product has in comparison to my first one Functionality and ease of use are outstanding right out of the the box. Super clear screen and weight is minimum and is a joy to use. This tablet is great for kids and adults who have little to no knowledge of computers. It handles easily and has plenty of storage My god sister has been using these for years.What to read more! The latest Amazon 8\" HD tablet is a very good tablet for the price. The updated processor and extra memory (with expansion slot) allow for very good performance on all that we use this tablet for. Netflix, Hulu, browsing the internet, and doing e-mails all work very smoothly. Would recommend to anyone looking for a very cost effective tablet totally worth the money, has all the apps I use on a daily basis! Good tablet. Wife loves it and would recommend.... I use mine mainly for its bigger screen. I do all the same things i do on my phone..but love the big screen. I bought one for eaxh of my nieces too. And they both love theres. Making videos..playing music..reading books. They bith love them! Im happy i got them for all of us. And always reccomend them to my friends for their kids too. Amazon Fire HD8 is a great product for the price. I picked it up for $69 during the holiday shopping season. Replacing a 1st gen Samsung Tab 2. This thing is sooo much faster. Perfect size for reading Kindle books , emails, and doing the social media thing. It was a good gift for the price and had many features and options Not as fancy as the ipad, but a fraction of the cost works well with android system and all apps like on our android phones, cant beat the price My kids can play, read, watch movies and much more love it!!! Great tablet for reading books, but the bluetooth is hard to get working and there are much better tablets for games and movies I love this Kindle!! I am biased I think however I have had 3 previous ones I prefer Kindles to any other tablet This is a great tablet for kids. I love that their time on the tablet can be restricted. Easy to use. Good size. Great eReader. Not so expensive that I worry about my kids using it. This Tablet was purchased for our Grandmother so she could play games and read books on. Bought a few of these for Christmas gifts .Everyone is happy !Its a great device for the $$. Low price, and great quality as always from FIRE devices. I purchased this item for my husband and he has liked reading Kindle books on it and the other features like Silk, etc. Light little tablet with good features. Bought this for our year end holiday party raffle prize pool. Great price and people always have a use for an amazon tablet. Came with Kaspersky for free as well, which is a pretty generous complimentary add on. My 6 yr old daughter got this tablet from Santa for Christmas. So far she loves it, a little too much perhaps.. I only use it to manage her account/permissions and so far haven\\'t had any issues with it.. Software and HW not quite as refined as apple iPad products, but what can you expect at the lower price point. my opinion its a good option for the cost. Not as great as Apple Ipad, but it costs so much less. Still can get good use Has many educational apps I would definitely go into the settings if you\\'re a mother like me who Is a very strict of what your children watch on TV or what games and apps they download I would definitely recommend setting the parental controls before giving it to them. In my personal opinion as a mother I feel it helps by setting the restrictions/content on It helps keep their mind away from the gutter Bcuz most apps and Internet websites have inappropriate sites children should not be watching. We can\\'t control what they put on the Internet but we can control what our children watch and download they stay very occupied on educational apps ,read books most of these apps are free to I also recommend NOT putting a payment method option other than that my kids loved it the hd feature is what sold me on this product, along with the fact its a lotmore streamline than the older version that I have Very nice for light internet browsing, keeping on top of email, viewing videos, and reading e books, which I like to get free from the library. Good browser, good battery power, fast charge. Very relaxing to sit in a comfy chair and read or browse. Has given me hours of enjoyment and information for a minimal price. I bought this for my wife to replace her old Kindle and she loves it. Much easier to read than an iPad and updated features make it a great purchase. Great tablet and price. Ordering online easy. Not happy took so long to receive though. Best tablet, good price, nice looking. Ordering on line was easy. I got this for my mom for Christmas. Every time I visit, she shows me something else she can do with it. I\\'m so jealous, I hope I get one. This is my fourth Kindle...upgrading each time. Mine goes everywhere with me and is used throughout the day. Wouldn\\'t be without it. We bought this for our son when he went to college. He is able to upload all of his books and other documents. I purchased it for my mother-in-law and she loves it it was easier for her to use and understand The Amazon Fire is amazing! Picture clarity and sound are excellent! I highly recommend this tablet! Love it! Sharp picture and easy to use. And a fantastic price I like this is great I bought it my friend he was pleased abount I wanted a low cost but quality tablet and this one is a dream! Easy to navigate and excellent graphics. This a great tablet for everyone. Plenty of memory for downloading. Great features all around. I own two Nook tablets, another Kindle and a Samsung and this is the best one yet. Excellent battery life. Lets me check emails the Web and with Kindle. books can be switched from reads to listens. Also works better than the Nook with audiobooks. I bought this tablet for my 4 year old daughter. Too many advertisements. I would rather pay more and not have a single ad. This is a step up from what my son was using. He said it does well and easy to use. This is a good tablet for kids who are starting off I bought this for my 6 year old and it\\'s perfect. Faster & clearer than older versions. Awesome good size large enough for games and photos Great gift easy to use and she loves being able to take it anywhere I bought this to replace the 7 inch version I lost in the airport. I wanted the bigger screen and the higher resolutions. It is much when loading games in offline mode as well as videos I have downloaded from Amazon Prime to play on the plane when wifi is not available. That was a plus for me. And now that the updated Netflix app allows the same thing, I have plenty of videos. I can also play my .mp4 videos using VLC player that I load to a microSD card. Of course you have wifi and Bluetooth so great for surfing try he net or listening to music. The 8 in screen is perfect for lying in bed and watching my show. I highly recommend this. Intuitive user interface, rapid online access through well designed features, light weight, ergonomic buttons for volume and power. Overall a thoroughly well designed, excellent priced device for web browsing and social media. PURCHASED THIS WITH A STORE CREDIT AND LIKE IT A LOT. COMPARES WELL WITH MORE EXPENSIVE TABLETS..RECOMMENDED great device for the price. good looking screen, quick and efficient. amazon app store isn\\'t that bad either Great gift for any age. Wish I bought two. I can do everything on this that I was doing on my ipad Great budget tablet for web browsing. Also useful as an MP3 player and ebook reader. I got 2 of these for my 8 yr old twins. My 11 yr old has one but this one is better. Perfect way to get them to read This is a superb tablet for the price. It doesn\\'t come with the Android operating system. It has Amazon\\'s operating system. The battery last a good long time and apps run very fast. I would recommend this to anyone who wants a tablet. My daughter love her new tablet, I use for a few days and it\\'s pretty good So very happy with the new kindle ! I highly recommend this product ! It may be cheap but this is a great tablet and works awesome. My wife absolutely loves this tablet. It wad an early Christmas present Bought for my 11 year old son and he absolutely loves it. I bought this as a Christmas gift for my son. Very easy to use. This product is very handy on the go. I can check emails and find work for my truck. I am an Amazon Fan. Ive only had Amazon tablets so I cant compare them with any other brand. But, Amazon has great customer service, a lot of great apps. The HD 8 is a great tablet for watching movies, most games, and social media. Its not as good as the Kindle fire hdx. The speakers arent as good, the hdx has more of a surround sound, but the hd 8 is less expensive, has a place for a sims card for extra space, and has an ok front and rear facing camera. Overall its a great tablet for a great price. I previously had bought an older model of these tablets for my children. I wasn\\'t to happy with them. But this tablet is great, it has child safety features like wether you would like to have them surf the web to even limiting the amount of hours your child can use it. Very good tablet for what my kids will use it for which is mostly Netflix Hulu and even though there isn\\'t you tube app there are alternate apps that acces you tube. Got this tablet for Black Friday. Wow, 16 gigs, great screen, expandable memory, what a deal. Tablet is a must have for Amazon Prime members. It unlocks the door for all those great Prime perks; books, shows, and shopping. Pairs to Alexa. Great screen for books! Buy it already! Bought it on black Friday for 60$ .Value for money tablet. It lags at heavy tasks and also apps are reloaded when 2-3 apps are opened at same time. But at this price it is expected. Go for it if budget is <100$. overall this is a good tablet. it is best with those who have Prime Amazon and the ability to watch Amazon video. a good price for a good tablet but has limitations based on the operating system. for video watching and basic use a good choice I love the size and portability of this. Keeps me in touch and having fun. Nice tablet and couldn\\'t beat the Black Friday price I\\'m sorry I didn\\'t buy it sooner! Very easy to use. Love it. It feels a bit more rugged than my original Fire tablet, and I believe it is an excellent value. Good tablet for basic needs. Screens resolution is pretty good. Mostly using for reading and sometimes for watching movies/shows. Great feature is the possibility to use the card to expand the memory. Good product for great price! Bought as a gift for my 86 yr old mom to stalk her kids and grandkids on FB. She mastered it in a few.minutes with minimal instruction. Now I have to watch my posts. For a cheaper price this does more than my kindle- love having this tablet Had a smaller version. Love the bigger screen. Use this product more than a computer. I bought 2 of the kindles for my grandsons. They love them! Had them charged and set up right away. No issues at this point. Easy to use bought for our 5 year old, found a case which allows him to keep it safe. Great 8 inches tablet with and amazing storage for apps. Santa dropped this off for our 4th grader along with expanded memory. he uses it for Netflix and Youtube as well as Minecraft and other Apps. Why spend hundreds on something for basic kids needs? I\\'m sure this will last him a few years and is well worth the price. Got this tablet for my 3 year old son and he can not put it down. It is so much to do. So many learning games. I love this product This tablet runs smooth with all amazon apps, the internet runs at a steady frame rate and it had a decent sized screen. This is a good device for entertainment and entry level tasks. I think it can do a lot for the price. Nice price for the new model with Alexa built in and expandable storage! I have enjoyed the new Kindle,however, was extremely disappointed that it does not have an HDMI port like the old version did. this product is really awesome for kids to play in all sorts.We can use a strong case and let kids play in it . i like the features it has and it is easy to navigate. This is perfect my kids to do their school work on and have fun as well. Great gift for my dad. Clear picture and easy set up Love my kindle! Works better than expected! Kindle is much faster than my old tablet! I have never owned a tablet. Wanted an I-Pad like most, but couldn\\'t afford the sticker price. This one fit my needs perfect. I mainly just use it for web surfing and streaming video. No complaints so far! I would recommend this device. also great for listening to music and also for movies The screen picture is crisp and bright. I will use this tablet for many things. small and powerful... great adult toy for a reader This was purchased as a Christmas present for my aunt who lives with us. For the price, I thought it would be a good option for her since she doesn\\'t want to drop the cash on an iPad.For comparison, the closest thing I have is an 8\" insignia tablet with similar screen resolution, storage, and features that was released at the same time. The Fire tablet impresses me! It is more responsive than the existing android tablet I have.This tablet runs FireOS which is Amazon\\'s customized version of Android. Typically I do not like custom Android, preferring to have as close to a vanilla system as possible. I am not bothered by that with the Fire. If you need them the parental controls are second to none! The Amazon app store is extensive, although not as extensive as the Google Play store. Still you should be able to find pretty much everything you need there.This is not a flagship device, but performs incredibly for the price. I will most likely be purchasing one soon for myself. I was hoping to use Google launcher with this tablet but it is really locked down and you cannot change the launcher or the lock screen. Still cheap and fine for watching movies. Great tablet for reading and also surfacing the web, along with your favorite social media apps! The price is low because Amazon uses their adds to subsidize the price. The actual tablet works well. The biggest negative is that you can only install apps from the Amazon store. There are many Android Apps available in the google store that are not available in the Amazon store.I primarily use the tablet for bible gateway, dish anywhere, play some games, read the newspaper, and Facebook. In the future I want to try to use it with my local library. Screen is very clear and battery last a long time. Very good substitute if you can afford a iPad. The tablet works fine. It is responsive with good resolution. It is too tied to Amazon. It requires too many hoops to get apps such as Zinio to work. Until Amazon loosens its grip, I recommend only at a very good price. A Great value for the money you can save instead of a Ipad from Apple. Fun and reliable. Good quality for the money. Easy to use. Great for reading - nice image, easy on the eyes and lightweight. Bought this for my 10 year old daughter for Christmas! She LOVES it!!! A great alternative to a pricey iPad Mini!!! She uses it for watching Netflix, YouTube and we use it for homeschool. We are very happy with our purchase!!! I got this tablet on sale for my wife and she loves it So far so good with the kindle fire hd. still need to play with it to see how to maximize our use. We love Kindle Fire, we purchase it for an older couple and it\\'s easy to work. The Amazon Fire is a great tablet with awesome graphics. I use it mainly for surfing the web and have had no issues with it. Purchased for my nephew for Christmas. Used it everyday. Very good product and screen size is perfect for him. Great tablet for the price. My granddaughter loves how user friendly it is. got this for my nieces aged 6-13 they loved it and so did their parents really keeps them occupied This was a gift for mom. She enjoys that it\\'s easy to use and has good picture and sound quality. The price was also great Was wanting a bigger screen, which it is, trying to get use to different applications, so far seems easy. The Amazon fire is simply amazing I would not buy anything else. Didn\\'t want to go to the sites amazon wanted me to. We bought this for our three daughters! Got a kid proof case and added free time for a low monthly fee and couldn\\'t be happier! So much better than worrying about them breaking my phone or iPad! I love my Kindle. I won\\'t be without one. I\\'ve even bought an extra one, just in case. I believe it\\'s the best tablet on the market. Bought one to replace the smaller (non HD) version. Lot faster and picture is noticeably better. Would recommend for anyone not wanting to spend the extra $50 or so on the big names. Could not have asked for a better tablet for the money. I wasn\\'t looking for anything extreme. Just wanted it to look nice and do it\\'s job for games and browsing. Well it does that and more. Gave it to our son for Christmas and now I want one myself. We are going to buy another for my mother in law. Lightweight, simple layout. Snappy. Can\\'t go wrong. It was a perfect gift for my godson. He loved it! Definitely would recommend this product. I can do a lot of things on my Kindle I used to rely on the computer for. Excellent resource for children video streaming by Wifi using mobile hotspot with kids. The kindle fire tablets are great for the price. They have solid performance in battery life and processing power. The only downside is that the Operating System is a different variation of Android, so there could be some incompatibilities. best choice under 100$ in marketamazon is the best!!! I really didnt expect how its going to work.but its very good.gifted to my friend Bought this as a gift for my mom and this was to replace her original Kindle Fire. She\\'s have had a month now and is loving and no problems with it. This was a request from our 7 yr old granddaugter who had always asked her older sister if she could share hers due to we bought this same tablet/size a few yrs earlier. Loved the security/parental control options.Starfall a favorite educational app were told is a must have. Really enjoy Pics/Viber due to their in a different state. Also some games on a time limit. Size and resolution are perfect. This is the best device I have found for my e-books. I know it can be used for a lot more, but it is my library in my hand. I bought this tablet to be pretty much exclusively an e-reader. It\\'s actually cheaper than most of the kindles. For that limited use, it works fine. I don\\'t think I would want to use it as a general purpose table (too slow!). Makes a fine e-reader though. As for recommending this to a friend, I would, but would make sure they knew what I use it for. I bought this as a Christmas present for my sister and she LOVES it. It\\'s easy to use, lightweight and doesn\\'t seem to have a lot of bugs or glitches. It\\'s a good source of entertainment for when she\\'s at work but has down-time. She passes the time reading ebooks, browsing the web and playing games. I originally purchased a Kindle paperwhite but returned it the next day and purchased this one. Very easy to read on, watch movies, and listen to music. Works well. Easy to use. Battery seems to be good. Would buy again. Ticks all the boxes I was looking for at a price I was happy to pay. One caveat that I (or the Best Buy and Geek Squad crews) was unaware of: there is a glitch in the keyboard that prevents it from working properly. Kindle/Amazon are aware of the glitch and will download a third-party keyboard fix to replace the keyboard that\\'s built in to the unit until they are able to fix the problem. I made Geek Squad aware of it and they should know about it now. Amazon MayDay functionality is not available and this was unexpected. Other services and functionality as expected Perfect tablet to take anywhere you go and lighter than my IPad. Easy to use tablet for every day use. Additional apps can help increase productivity for work and daily use. This tablet does all I need a tablet to do. Reason why it\\'s my 3rd one. Bought this tablet for my fiancée daughter, after getting it home and set up, I decided to keep it for myself. Great screen and works great with my pair of Amazon echos. I love it and highly recommend it. This is my first Amazon e-reader-tablet and the second e-reader I have. It is easy to use once you get through the initial hoops. I like the free games and the fact that I new can load books from my computer to the tablet. And one thing, I am not in the market for a tablet but for a bigger e-reader. It is a lot better than the Nook that I have. I love this product Bought as a gift for parents who aren\\'t tech savy but were able to use it with ease I have Bought several versions of this tablet for my kids over the years and have been ever impressed with it. I first got one for my son, the my oldest daughter to replace her children\\'s tablet, which was worthless, this tablet gives you everything you could want and allows you to control what your kids access on it and even lets you see what they download onto it. if you want to set a time when it shuts off at night you can, when they can play games or use Netflixs you can...great product! Great gift for a younger person who wants a tablet The fire is great. The size is really nice. Not to big. The clarity is really good. This inexpensive tablet does everything I want it to do. I can read my books and magazines and keeps tabs on my kids and grandkids on Facebook. Very easy to use and crystal clear pictures and video. Great entry level tablet for kids or anyone that will not be heavily using a tablet. The 16 GB, is too small but can add an SD card. Beware only comes with 6GB of the 16 for your apps. Comes with bunch of preloaded Amazon apps. This tablet is great. I loved the color and all the features it has. I will be buying more for my daughters. Great purchase What I expected. A better then budget tablet ata good price. Bought for the integration with Alexa and it works well, more info about your Alexa request will show up automatically on the tablet. It\\'s a excellent tablet for my kid she downloaded games and watch cartoons I was looking for a Good tablet under $100..this delivered..getting used to Amazon apps LOL Excellent ratio quality price. Lightweight. Good resolution and easy to use. After long review decided to buy the Fire Tablet as a gift for a great frienday. She loves it! It\\'s the perfect size and has all the features she was looking for in a tablet. Happy Birthday! Love everything about my Kindle. I\\'m a long-term Amazon Prime member. Great tablet for the price. My father in law likes the easy use of the tablet. The Fire is an excellent table for many basic tasks. Not a good product short battery life i can only use for 20 minutes I was looking for something to read on and this fit the bill for the right price.Great screen clarity, good adjustment too. Works well and the battery life is great. Size is nice too. Big enough for 1 hand if needed. This is a great tablet for books, games and web browsing. It is very user friendly, -and I would definitely recommend this product! I enjoy to use the reader and like the idea that I can go to the internet from the Kindle. I thought that this tablet was junk but it has surpassed my expectations I wasn\\'t really expecting much, however I was pleasantly surprised.It feels solid, responsive, screen is good.For the price its a bargain!! Good if you want something inexpensive and Will do the minimum very well. I like this ipads for my baby and me too,special and super ok thanks byee I found it to be very versatile and enjoyable benefiting from a touch screen. Ipad killer! A fierce tablet at a convinient price! bought as a gift she loves it all kinds of apps easy to use and even easyer with amazon prime I bought it as the display for my Echo. Turning on Voicecast routes information to the tablet with the voice reaponse. It\\'S been exactly what I hoped it would be and the price was right. This tablet is exactly what I was looking for to take on trips. The kids can watch their movies and videos, or I can read from my kindle library. Perfect size. I bought this as a gift for my son and I know he will love it he has the old kindle fire as likes it a lot My mom had an old one, she was so excited to get this one. Works great and is fast. Great for reading and internet use This Kindle is so overloaded with apps that I will never use. Despite what one of Best Buys\\' associates said, you cannot remove any of the Amazon apps. The apps take up too much of the memory. I have an I Pad and love but bought this as a backup for work. Unfortunately, it bogs down. I also don\\'t like that Amazon wants access to too much info to set up email, so I won\\'t use this for emails either. I will likely sell it on Craig\\'s List for less than half of what I paid for it. Fine for reading, ...haven\\'t used it for anything else yet I have been using a Kindle Fire for a couple of years. It was a good tablet, until the screen went black. Best Buy replaced it and I couldn\\'t have been more pleased. I enjoy reading on my Kindle Fire HD more than ever. Try it and you\\'ll buy it! A viable substitute for the more expensive I Pad especially for kids wanting a tablet. You can download books, games, email and access the internet. Parental controls are easily enabled. blueray is just twhat I was I was looking for great for watching movies thank you Love best buy and I shop at Best Buy I always buy my TV for me and my kids I buy my kids tablets at Best Buy Love Best Buy Got this for my mom for her birthday, and she absolutely loves it. Great tablet for the price point, good tablet overall. I love all of them. I would recommend going to Best Buy and buying a kindle fire before they are sold out! Nice size screen easy and light weight to take to class This tablet is great for my son. Would be nice if it had a little more horsepower My 76 year old mom loves this! She now has something to do while waiting in doctors offices - loves to read, do crosswords, etc. I enjoy it more then the I-pad that its replacing. Easy to read in any light and the size is perfect for travel. I absolutely love my kindle 8! Great picture, storage & sound. Can\\'t live without my kindle! I liked it at first except the browser is kind of clunky. Also you can. It use all android Apps. The worst thing though was mine just stopped working in the middle of watching a movie on a long plane flight. It was fully charged. I have tried recharging and turning on etc. it is just a blank screen and off. Kind of a cool paperweight. Hope I can get my money back. Or get a new one. Love my mine! Works great with prime! And I have all my best movies! I bought this for my dad in his late 60s mainly to listen to music and read ebooks borrowed from the library. I set it up for him and he loves it. I just don\\'t like that it has ads on the start up unless you pay to get rid of them. Enjoy reading books on it as well as viewing videos. Got two for my mom\\'s and they love it. So many great features!!! this tablet is awesome. the fact that I can use a micro sd card to have more memory and can listen to my content on the card is great. the additional screen size is what I wanted and it has not disappointed. this was a great purchase!!! I\\'m very happy with my Kindle Fire. Beyond being able to read books, it does all sorts of things and is able to download a huge variety of apps. It also holds a charge very long. The size is perfect and portable, yet the screen is much larger than a smartphone, which I love. I would definitely recommend this tablet to others! The Amazon Fire HD 8 is an awesome device. THE PRICE OF THIS TABLET IS MIND BOGGLING!! This tablet has everything you would expect and want in a tablet and more. It has Amazon Store and Amazon Prime preloaded. It\\'s so much fun and so easy to use. THE PERFORMANCE OF THIS TABLET IS UNBELIEVABLE. You never stop thinking about the modest price you paid for such a fantastic tablet. It feels comfortable in your hands. The design is nice. The size is adequate for all tablet use. You can expand the memory storage of this device an additional 240GB. Can you believe it? Outstanding!! Bought as a Christmas present. Son uses it to watch youtube and Netflick. Works great. The overall design makes it fir very nice in the hand. It is very easy to setup and has features that I did not utilize on previous Fire tablets. I like the camera and the Blue Shade ability. I like to read before bed and the color really does help me wind down. Long lasting battery! Got this Fire tablet for my youngest daughter for Christmas and she loves it. I also love the option to restrict apps and content for her age! I bought two of these Amazon Fire HD tablets in December as Christmas gifts. Both recipients are happy with these as gifts. I plan to purchase one in the near future for myself. Biting as a gift, my only concern was the size and the Amazon interface. It was easy enough to download the Google play store, so it was familiar to the user. Size was an initial concern, but it was just right to watch movies without being so cumbersome. My son really likes the larger screen to play games. Very easy to use and has so much to offer for the low price. great product, easy to use, love the lighted pad, ease of down loading books, They were using them on Christmas morning!! It didn\\'t take them long too be getting the best from those tablets So I think I would have rated 5 stars however when I got my tablet home my 8 year old used it for a total of 2hrs...the next day it had a reboot screen similar to Dos windows. Excellent customer service at store allowed me to exchange next day. No problems with the second one. Great tablet for the price. i love it amazon is nice read book on it play games on it I bought this Kindle as a gift for my mother so she could access her Facebook account easily. She loves the ease of using it. I have 3 kindle tablets in my home and they are used daily. My mother uses hers for email and some light gaming and for watching Netflix as well. Very satisfied. I wanted a low cost internet device to feed internet radio choices into my stereo. This fit the bill well. I use the headphone jack to connect with my stereo and get great sound. I don\\'t use most of the other apps that come on the device. The Kindle Fire is a wonderful, small device to use for a multitude of tasks. We use it mostly as an ereader and has been so simple to use. So happy we chose this one. It is lightweight and convenient to take with you. I bought this as a temporary replacement for my wife\\'s 11\" Kindle Fire HD that was out for service. She liked this 8\" model so much that she continued using it after the 11\" one returned. I tested this item before I gave it as a gift. It is simple enough for the needs of browsing, social media and entertainment. Definitely best price for simple needs compared to spending $100s on an iPad This feels like an affordable tablet. While not the best in class, it isn\\'t priced to be that either. Works well. Happy with purchase. Great for watching sports events away from home but within wi fi range. So easy to download and then read. Enjoy reading that I can take anywhere without the heaviness of a book I bought this after subscribing to an Amazon Prime membership. This is a great little tablet at such a low price.. too good of a deal to pass up when it was on sale. It has the ability to talk to Alexa, surf the web, listen to music and read books/magazines (lots of free music and books for Prime members). If ads dont bother you, then this may be a decent device. Purchased this for my kid and it was loaded down with so much spam, it kept loading it up making it slow and laggy. Plus the carrasoul loadout makes it hard to navigate for kids, not very kid friendly! Oh you can pay $15 to remove the ads but it wont remove them all. Buy the samsung, better everything! This is my second Fire, I\\'m upgrading from the 2nd generation 7\" model. Love the screen resolution. Movies and videos are sharp and no pixelating. The camera is a bonus my first version did not have. All together this was a great buy for under $100 on sale. Thank you Best Buy. I would buy it again and have twice over already. I actually bought the kids fire kindle and bought this for my wife, her\\'s was lost and she borrowed my sons kid fire kindle I ended up buying her this again, and would buy it again. I would recommend buying a sd card it fills up fast without out it but it is a lot cheaper to buy the lower GB kindle and then buy a good sd card. This tablet has it all. Amazon offers tons of free apps, hundreds of thousands of free e-books and tons of free games. The tablet is intuitive and intelligent. I seamlessly enjoy streaming my favorite shows and reading articles, books and periodicals. What I love most is that the tablet doesn\\'t place all apps on the device, but uses the users miro SD card instead for up to 200GB of additional storage for a dizzying amount of storage for more games, apps, books and movies that can be downloaded and enjoyed. It also allows the owner to share the device with family members, delegating each member an account personalized and tailored to that individual. There is even an option to create children\\'s accounts--extra bonus. I am able to mirror the content from the tablet onto my Samsung Smart television. I will definitely consider Amazon first and foremost when making any future tablet purchases. It maintains a charge for a good deal of time, alleviating the need to be near an outlet to enjoy using it. I can charge it in the evening and use it for several hours the next day, sometimes two days. No one will ever create a tablet that is more considerate of the owner/end-user. I love to read and this tablet makes it so easy to carry an entire library with me everywhere. I have also become addicted to the free underground games. Bought this 8\" model to use in addition to my current 3 year old Kindle Fire HD (7 inch model). So far I am very pleased with the quality of this unit. The slightly larger screen makes watching movies much better. I didn\\'t want the larger 10\" screen (yet). I purchased this on Black Friday because I could pass on the price. The tablet works great for basic internet needs and great for shopping on Amazon. If I were to purchase another Android Tablet, I will look for something with a little more power since this tablet slows when multi-tasking. I bought this for my son (he\\'s 1.5 years old) so he could play basic toddler games, but I found the tablet to be extremely useful for school with it\\'s large screen and super long battery life. I\\'m waiting for the Surface Pro 5 but this tablet that I got for so cheap is making me second guess paying so much! For basic lecture taking notes and watching Netflix or Hulu and kid games, this can\\'t be beat. The best tablet for the price i use it everyday to watch youtube videos Great purchase for my granddaughter for Christmas. This tablet is perfect for just about anything you could want to do on a tablet. My grandmother enjoys this tablet ... it use as her reader. Great item at great price, MY WIFE LOVES IT AND WONT PUT IT DOWN! great black friday deal for a mediocre tablet. android os though! Wanted a tablet at a cheap price and this item fit the bill. Bought on Black Friday which made the price even better. The screen looks good and the performance for the apps I have used so far have met expectations. I mainly used for surfing the web, youtube, and netflix. This device handles each with ease. Overall, I am satisfied with this device. Works well; no issues with reboots or system hangs.. Good size - not too big and not too small. Screen is good for reading. Battery life is good, I\\'ve bought a few books from Amazon but mostly side-loaded books from the library onto a 32 GB micro sd card. Though I have got it for cheap price during black friday, this Fire is not that great. Very bad camera and dim screen resolution. Pros:Install Google Play without any hassleVery good book reading option I got this for my son and he loves it! He can play games, watch movies, you tube videos, and use the internet for help with homework. He also loves all the books, and aps. Was a great black Friday deal should have gotten one for myself. I got it at a great price. They price matched for me. Much faster then getting my laptop out to check email I purchased this product for my youngest son! He loved the color and the size. The storage is great for the number of activities that he has downloaded! Was looking for a tablet to run my remote music server with from my easy chair. My first tablet I bought at about the same price ran through the battery in an hour. Amazon product is much better for battery life and image quality is very nice. This product is easy to use. Screen size is great. Would recommend to anyone. I got it for my kid and she loves it. The amazon free time and prime well worth the money Best tablet around, cheaper than most and does just as much as other tablets. Great buy, it works perfect! Battery lasts a few days too. She likes to read books and this is a fast and cheap way for her to do so It\\'s a great buy. Just to read emails and go on the web Great Christmas gifts for the kids. Hours of fun and games. I purchased this tablet mostly for entertainment. I enjoy playing games and this tablet is great for that purpose. Also plan on using it for reading electronic books. Very nice quality product. East to set up and use. So much more screen size than previously kindles. Fast charging. Longer battery life. Purchased for my mom to read ebooks, great performance, screen looks good, easy to use. Very happy with this purchase. less expensive than last year with so many more features and bigger screen! Bought for my wife for X-mas and she loves it. Hasn\\'t put it down This is a good product for video, surfing and reading. However this version has dropped all android support as far as I can tell. I have a couple of apps that run on my old Fire just fine but are extremely problematic on this one. There is one app I use everyday but it doesn\\'t work on this new Fire, so I have to keep the old one around. Kind of inconvenient. I would recommend seeing if your app is supported on this Fire before dropping the money. This was a reasonable replacement for a broken tablet. Purchased this tablet for my two year old son. It is easy for him to use and has been surprisingly durable. Would recommend the replacement plan if purchasing for a child. Better and faster than Kindle 7\". Great performance for the price. Love it, easy to operate. Very reasonable price - on sale. Good product. Onboard storage does fill up quickly. Bought as a gift to my dad and he likes it so far. It\\'s fast enough for apps and great for reading Works great but the app store is nothing like that of Apple or Google. Fortunately, you can install many Android apps from 1Mobile. The screen is fabulous and it\\'s great at its roots: making reading books fun. I love this tablet. I know it\\'s not an iPad or any of the big tablets but it does just what I need it to do. I\\'ve had it a few weeks now. I\\'ve downloaded videos, read a few books and played some games. I\\'ve had zero problems so far. I know it\\'s not the best video, but for the price of the tablet I don\\'t expect it to look like my flat screen TV. I\\'m trying not to load too many things to keep it from slowing down. So far so good. Browsing the internet is easy too. I\\'m getting used to the browser and the app store for Amazon. For the price of this tablet it\\'s not too shabby!!! You can do some many things and the best part apps for free on Amazon underground! Works great for my 6 year old. Wanted an inexpensive tablet for himsince he can be pretty rough with things. So far so good, and we love the FreeTime app. Was looking to get an inexpensive tablet that ran Android. The Amazon Fire tablet was a much better value than other similar products. Have been very happy with the tablets durability and quality so far too. Would recommend to anyone looking for a lower-end tablet. Bought 2 for each of our teenagers and they just love it... Very cool reading features and zero buffering while watching Netflix. Good quality product. Clear display and easy to use. My mother, husband, and daughter all enjoy using Fire. It\\'s a great way to stay preoccupied. Out of all the tablet choices out there we buy these for our children over any other. You can\\'t beat the price and durability. very good product and right on the cost! Great gift for the holidays. Purchased this for reading and the price. Good value for money. Great for reading, game playing, searching the web and social media. I really like the Fire IS 8 16gb, it is fast and smooth. Does everything a regular tablet can and for the price you really can\\'t beat it This is so easy to use and does exactly what I hoped. Great tablet for streaming ! good internet connection along with a nice display Bought it as an e-reader. Convenient and easy to use. Text is very readable. I am pleased. This is a nice little tablet for the $60 I paid on black Friday. At the regular price I would probably have gone with something a little less restricted and without so much Amazon content. The lock screen ads aren\\'t much of a problem, I understand Amazon sells these cheap and gets it back via ads, but the 15-20 Amazon apps are a little much. It would be easier to stomach if you could add the ones you want or remove the ones you don\\'t. That said, I was able to install the Google Play store and this tablet does everything I need it to do. Overall, I\\'m pretty happy with the purchase. It\\'s a nice new toy. One note: In the online photos the magenta looks purple. It\\'s actually pink. If you like purple, get a black one and a purple case. So cool after playing with this for a while now I would never spend the money on an apple for what I am doing with it. Love the new fire hd 8. Price is amazing and if you are an amazon prime mbr its even better! Great for the kids as you can lock their profiles to a kids mode and they can\\'t buy anything. If i had one downfall its the smaller amount of apps available than apple or google play. Had the Fire HD 7\" before and just wanted to upgrade. Loving it so far and really enjoying the bigger screen! The tablet is not for me it is for a Christmas gift This was a great buy for my son. He needed something that he could easily transport and that woudl allow him to access the internet and various forms of media. This was a perfect choice since he also has a amazon Prime account. This was replacement for my wife\\'s original iPad and broken Kindle Paperwhite. She loves it, as it does basically everything both of the previous devices did in one unit that is easy to use, has good battery life, very nice screen resolution and good size for her. Great value, especially compared to an iPad. for the price this is a great works well the for the price display is hd love it for the money, you will be well pleased, I think it is a big bargain ! I purchased this tablet for my mother, but I set it up and tested it out. It is super fast! I have the original Kindle Fire and all I can say is Amazon has come a long way! The new Fire HD8 is so much better than the original! I like it so much that I am thinking of purchasing one for myself! I would highly recommend this tablet to anyone! I have had a Kindle before, and needed a new one as the old one would no longer charge very well. Still adjusting to some different features from the original one. Do not like the fact that it is difficult to find a case for this one. Very happy with this purchase, it was exactly what I was looking for My original Kindle Fire no longer accepted a charge. I wasn\\'t going to replace it, because I bought an iPad. When I saw the HD8 in a kiosk in a BB store, I realized how much better I liked the size and feel of it for reading books (the iPad is preferred for other things). This Fire\\'s clarity is much improved over my old one, plus it responds better. I don\\'t like that I can\\'t choose a photo for the locked screen - that it HAS to be an advertisement. I also don\\'t like that it usually takes a few trys to unlock. Menial issues from my perspective. It\\'s a good starter tablet, to bad it runs on the Amazon OS. Got this for my sister as a Christmas present and she loved it.Easy to use and great for books. This is my third Kindle, I still have the other two; however, this has a camera and much larger screen. I would take this product any day over a tablet. Look forward to hearing more from my grandkids so far they love it Good small tablet for all purposes for reading, playing games My wife and kids love easy to use and the size is perfect Great tablet for beginners! Very light and screen is wide. Enjoy using for travels. Fast processing great battery reads to me when my eyes bother me. Expandable memory a big plus. The new kindle fire hd is good and my son loves it Got this for my grandmother and she absolutely loves it. She loves to use it to watch Netflix and play games This is just the right size and can put games on it just like an iPad. I wanted a new kindle fir a while. The price was right The display is not as sharp and vivid as they say but still good. Probably better for reading than watching videos. We didn\\'t really get it for the games, but there is a good selection. WiFi works well and internet browsing is fast. The Kindle is a great way to read and watch videos with ease! Exciting tablet still amazed by the ease of use great product all in all Couldn\\'t beat the value for this with the Black Friday price. They aren\\'t the best tablets, but they do a lot for the price. great size,sound and battery. just buy it already. Love the tablet mainly use for games and internet. Grrat product foe the price. She hasn\\'t used the it yet, but my son did a quick check and it seems just fine. I\\'ve had my other Kindle Fire for 5-6 years. It\\'s still working but slowing down. I bought the updated version while it was on sale. I love it! I play games on it, download books, check my email and facebook. It\\'s like a portable mini computer and I wouldn\\'t be without it. I like it better than other people\\'s tablets and you can\\'t beat the price. I bought some for gifts and everybody loves it! I\\'d recommend it to people of all ages. Great product, no complaints at all,good for kids and adults At ninety dollars, the expectionations are low, but this is still a very good table, it\\'s good for light use like watching videos or web browsing, but the camera is a bit lacking, and at certain times the device can freeze or lag. Overall this is a good tablet for $90, I would recommend this to anyone on a budget. Good starter unit. Easy for a beginner to use. Priced low to give you a taste of the tablet world. The Parental Options need some work. You can\\'t even log in to a child account until you have Apps loaded for them to use. Also a kid\\'s login doesn\\'t have access to pre-loaded apps (like the calculator). Seems really odd to me that you can\\'t give them access to basic functionality of the tablet.Otherwise, the tablet itself works great. Bought a Fire HD 8 tablet for my wife. She doesn\\'t like using computers and avoids smartphones, but her new tablet is a big hit. She uses it to play games and to stream movies and radio programs. I use it for everything else -- reading news, checking e-mail, online shopping, etc. It was very easy to set up and even easier to use. Plenty of speed and capacity to do everything we want. We already own kindles so we know they are great ! My son is going to live this! I purchased 2 of these FIre HD tablets as gifts. They pack a lot of punch for the price. I helped set them up so I was able to get an idea of how they are going to work. The screen was very nice and clear. Speed of tablet was good. It is easy to use. If you are already in the Amazon family through prime it is a no-brainer.I don\\'t believe you can get a better tablet at this price point. I bought these as a starter online browser. It is a very portable pad . Great price. Just what my wife wanted and needed she loved it! It is easy to use and simple to set up! Good tablet for the money. A good add on if you have Amazon prime You can\\'t beat the price. Great deal for what you\\'re paying. We bought it for our 9 yr. Old daughter and she loves it. We do as well. Kindle tablets are great! its fast, it has good lighting. its got the 16gb space, best gift ive bought for a bookreader. I love it.....Reading E books here is so easyPerfect for price With a $20 off deal last blackfriday, who will not get it. Much clearer and faster than the other fire HD. Light weight too If you shop on Amazon all the time, this will help make it easier still. Lots of ads pop up, and you can\\'t use apps from non-Amazon sources unless you root it, and that is complicated. This is not a realistic alternative to an iPad or Galaxy Note. If you just want to a device to shop on Amazon with, you\\'ll love it. This is my 2nd Fire tablet. I will alwyas need one. Just wish they lasted longer than 4 years. fire tablet is very powerful for the size and does everything! While there are some apps that are missing due to not using the Google Play Store the list is minimal. The tablet itself is quick, responsive, and noticeable nicer than the 7\" fire. Picked this up when it was on sale for black friday sales. It\\'s great for in front of the TV and catching up on email and light web browsing. Price was fabulous for an entry level tablet. Right on Was impressed how quick and responsive touch and overall speed.Including Alex app.fit in top coat pocket I have been buying Kindles since they first came out. When ever I want to upgrade Kindle is my chosen brand. I am not very tech savvy and I enjoy watching movies, listening to music and primarily reading. I like the ability to purchase narration for my favorite titles and using text-to-speech for the rest. Have not used these yet as they are Christmas gifts Wife loves this thing. She reads nonstop on it. She can\\'t put it down Nice for the price had to put Google play store on myself but still a nice tablet This is a really good tablet for adults but especially great for kids as you can load movies or add apps that they can use. The cost is so low you just can\\'t beat it. Plus, the main feature for me was the Amazon Kindle name on the product which puts it way ahead of the no name tablets on the market. Great product and gift. I purchased two of these on Black Friday. What a great purchase. These are very inexpensive and have the ability to do so many things for the kids. I later bought tough cases to keep any damage minimal. I love my kindle. I bought the larger screen after owning 2 previous 7 inch screens. this tablet has the best battery ive ever seen. The picture is great too. LIke that there are lots of apps to choose from. Very user friendly I wanted a new tablet and saw the 7\" on sale at Christmas, my husband was offered the 8\" for just $10 more, so good value ! Thin and light weight. Easy to start up. I would have liked to have a booklet on featuers and use, etc. Nothing in print came with it other than one paper . Tutorials on set up and where the buttons and slots were. I have enjoyed the quick loading to start, just wish I had a physical booklet on how to\\'s, not just online tutorials. More features In several ways than iPad. This android tablet is really powerful I bought this for my wife because she plays a lot of games along with my grandson, this is perfect to download all the games they want without taking up space on her iPad. Great to take with me when I need alone time to just surf and read. Love the tablet! Easy to use and easy to take with Awesome tablet! Love using it to read and surf the web. It matters what preference you prefer with tablets. I mean if you use windows or google more this might not be for you. For me, I use Amazon music, video, books, and shopping so this tablet is awesome. It\\'s made especially for Amazon ecosystem users. Its light and has a nice feel. I live the blue shade option it has for less blue light when reading. Enjoy having the kindle. My son uses all the time for reading. It has helped him improve in his reading skills. We are glad we bought it. Thank you. This was one of the best birthday presents, I ever purchased for my husband. He said he doesn\\'t use the computer, but he was on my smartphone daily viewing FB. I got him a drone for Christmas and he needed something to view, while it is flying. I researched the Kindle Fire and thought he could practice with it until spring. He farms, so isn\\'t busy in the winter. Thank goodness, because he is busy with his Kindle for hours every day. He thinks it is great and I do too, because now I have my phone back. I really enjoy reading. So much so I was running out of shelf space. I have read a few books with my I-pad mini but it really didn\\'t do the trick. No so with my new Amazon Fire Hd-8. Handy sized, not the least bit heavy and super bright. Add in the face that digital material from magazines to novels are often as not far cheaper that \"hard copies\". Amazing video quality easy to maneuver wonderful screen size easy set up Great tablet other than the photo image quality is fuzzy and not the best. The Fire HD8 strikes an excellent balance between performance and price. It has many of the features you\\'d want in a tablet for a fraction of the cost. Works flawlessly for reading and video streaming. This is my second Kindle and I love it. It\\'s lightweight, simple, and fast. It\\'s convenient for trips and fits in my bag without weighing it down. Bought this as a gift. My mother likes it. It\\'s easy and simple to use. I am loving my fire tablet and I am using it everyday at home and at work on break I will be ordering Amazon fire for my two granddaughters because they love Nana\\'s so much Really beautiful display is great for watching movies and playing games. It is very powerful for the price and you can play lots of games from Amazon for free - they even remove microtransactions from lots of games.Only downside is you need Amazon Prime to get the most out of your tablet Very little set up, Amazon helpful in setting up the functions. Clear pictures and easy to use. Take pictures both ways Graphics are great for the price. Would highly recommend. Bought this for my mom and it was just what she needed and at a great price. Been wanting to get an Ipad for myself, but think this might be a great less expensive option for me as well. The pad worked as I thought but the screen wasn\\'t as vibrant as our iPads. Still a great deal for the price. Perfect thing I needed to read books on and play my games I\\'m loving the tablet so far. I really like the Amazon underground, and the Fire OS just updated, so it has Alexa on it now. :) this tablet is perfect for surfing the internet and following social media I like the shape and size of this Kindle, and the graphics are good. But if I play a game for very long the charge seems to run out pretty quickly. It is very good for books and for music. I would recommend it for those categories. For its price. Amongst the others I felt this was a deal Perfect size and very responsive. I have 4 of them. No issues runs games and internet well. ,,,,,,,,,,,, It is very easy to use for children . We have loved having one and are hoping to buy another one for kids Christmas !! good price for the product. I purchased for my middle school son. not good, hate it , never buy it again, sucks. done Smartphone works on the job for me, but with the Fire I can read instructions and worksheets. It is a useful tool for connecting with both friends and colleagues. 8-inches is the right size for holding in hand and carrying with you. Gives me the information, beats printing everything out, or carrying around a large laptop. Think this will be a great product for my parents it is a Christmas gift. The Amazon fire tablet is an excellent product. I primarily use it to purchase and read books from Kindle. Also, I use it for my Facebook activity. The battery life is long and it recharges quickly. My 10 year old son also enjoys using it. I would highly recommend this product to others. My husband is a truck driver and being on the road away from home, he likes to have shows and movies to watch. This has so much space for him to download things to watch. A great Kindle reader. Easy to order, read and store books. Also speedy for finding Amazon products and ordering them. But the other apps are really slow - too slow. Easy to use as a tablet and easy to use as a ebook reader Not sure if this is due to the new version but I\\'m not able to install or even sideload certain apps onto the tablet. Amazon is really trying to lock out non-Amazon apps namely ones from Google. Aside from that though, performance is already and what you\\'d expect from a tablet in this price range. This was purchased for my mom and it does what\\'s needed and my mom has no complaints thus far. Tablet is working good for what we wanted it to do. Still waiting for Alexa to function. Several calls to Amazon supportled to conflicting answers on how to get it to work, then told it isnot yet available on all Fire HD 8 tablets. The Amazon Fire Hd8 has great features. The size is perfect to carry anywhere. Excellent apps and accessible to books, movies, games etc. Clear screen. it was very quick and easy to setup and begin using. I have had several budget tablet, but this blows them all away. You have to be willing to be invested in the Amazon ecosystem, but it is well worth it. This tablet is a good one for everyday use. It is small but it has a clear image. Not sure if I really wanted one this small but its ok for now. This does not run Android, so no Google Play store. Amazone apps are moztly the same titles, but not all are available that you can get through Google Play. Bought this for our daughter and she enjoys it. If you have an Amazon Prime subscription you can get a lot more out of this tablet as well. Bought for daughter, love the parental control and curfew setting I like the portability of it. I take it with me when I babysit my granddaughter. bought as a gift she loves it great with amazon prime Had the previous version of this tablet and was looking to upgrade. Got this on sale and am very pleased. My daughter love this tablet! Easy to use and carry The best kindle fire ever, love how quickly the apps run, being able to watch movies, listen to music, etc. on it The salesman was very good pointed us in the right direction. The tablets are perfect for our triplet grandsons. Excellent value for the price. Super easy to use and set up. Wonderful display. I love the fact that you can add an sd card for more memory unlike the old Kindles. Plus I\\'m really impressed with the fact the Amazon has such great offers. I love my kindle. It fast, great pict quality and is so convenient to use. I love using it to watch Netflix. It worth the purchase if you don\\'t want to spend so much money. I love this tablet!! Excellent quality speakers and screen. Lots of storage space. Worth the money!! Bought it for my husband and he loves it. This is perfect for what he wanted it for. Very fast and super easy to use I\\'m very pleased with this purchase!! It\\'s works really well and don\\'t have any issues at all Tablet is good for beginners and those that like to read The Kindle Fire has great features for the price. The video quality is asstounding. It worked really well for me as I am unschooled in ipads. I used it while traveling and it was easy to use and did the things I needed, i.e. maps, books downloaded, internet access, youtube, etc.. I don\\'t play games, so cannot comment on that. If you want a tablet to use on a daily basis for facebook or do online purchases you couldn\\'t ask for a better tablet. I use to read books, watch movies, and get online.. it works great and easy to use. I bought this to replace a Samsung Galaxy Tab 3. I absolutely love the Kindle HD 8. It was easy to set up and very easy to find my way around. The only reason I took off 1 star is that I have found some apps are not available for Kindle. But so far from info I have read online there are ways to resolve this issue. Just a simple kindle. Doesn\\'t have the glass back. Throughly enjoying my fire tablet. Can play games and read books. Am very pleased with it. Excellent screen , fast response. Almost a steal for that price. Much harder to work than an android. None of the wallpaper apps I downloaded from the kindle store work on the device. many of the other apps look cheap on the display. other wise it is prettier and more responsive than the cheaper $49 tablet. They make it look like an android tablet but it is not. no google play. Everything is just harder to work than on a regular android BUT for a tablet under $100 it exceeds expectations. It is more responsive than other models of fire Kindle Fire is a dream. Larger screen easy to read I HAVE BEEN WITH AMAZON PRIME FOR 2 YEARS AND THIS NEW FIRE HD MAKES IT WORTH IT. i WATCH MOVIES WHEN I FLY BECAUSE I CAN DOWNLOAD THEM. THE BATTERY LAST FOR DAYS. I USE IT EVERYDAY NOW. Well worth the 80 bucks, especially if you are an Amazon Prime member. You can download and watch anything on there for free, including movies and magazines. The screen is a bit on the darker side, but the battery life is great. I have both an IPAD and this, and I use both. Great when you are waiting for your IPAD to recharge... Reading is easy, can make font as large as you need Improved over the HD 7. Things set up differently but not hard to learn. Also a bit heavier than the 7 so reading in bed a little harder Not to much to complain about. for less than 100 dollars you get an 8in tablet that has pretty good specs; expandable storage, long battery life, great speakers, fast processor, decent cameras and hi def screen. easy to use and well built tablet....The only knock is the included adds but, after using it for awhile you barely notice it. I\\'ve purchased a number of Kindle Fire products for family over the past several years and continue to use them. Easy to use for even my youngest Grandchildren or my 87 year old Mother-In-Law which they use as a reader and for games. An overall good value. This is the fastest booting tablet I have come across. The speed at which I can access sites is really amazing. I went into bestbuy to purchase a replacement after mine died. I loved my kindle, and decided to get 2-in-1 with the fire. It is perfect for my needs. I had fire hdx 8 and loved it, unfortunately got damaged and could not replace. I purchased the fire HD 8 and exchanged n pay difference for fire HD 10. The 8 did not have a lot of options I was used to. :( great product at a great price.i like the builtin filter which is easy on youreyes.probably the best reader under 100 dollars. Very good product. Super quality and the Best Buy store rep explained me about the product This is my third Kindle Fire and it improves each time. Colors are crisper and best of all it stays charged a lot longer. I bought this for my sister, who already had the Kindle 7. For the price the 8 is better. First the obvious. a inch more screen does make a difference and the HD makes reading and streaming alot clearer. Being able to add more storage with a micro SD card is a huge plus as well. This device includes a camera! And last at under 100.00 makes this a huge value for a great tablet. Excellent. Just as good as iPad with a fraction of the price. The Amazon Fire HD8 (2016 model) is a great tablet for the price; however, the Fire OS offers limited abilities to the user. Personally, I wish there were ways to mirror the screen to a tv without having to purchase a Fire TV streaming stick. Also, the inability to use the google play store is a major set back. If it weren\\'t for those two complaint, I\\'d give this tablet 4 stars. I really love the new shape and size of the kindle HD. My daughter uses it and can control it great. I\\'m loving this new fire, mainly because I didn\\'t fork out a couple hundred for it. My only beef is that magazines are formatted for the demensions of an iPad so don\\'t look great on this Love my tablet easy to work and have no problem with down loads.and lite weight. Works okay as a tablet and especially to access Amazon.No good as a general tablet as there are no Google apps available, such as Chrome, gmail, etc. I love this Kindle. I love the fact that you can use an SD card for more storage. Great job The device is priced just right to give as a gift for an 8 year old We have had a hard time with tablets and our 8 year old who has been down loading apps since she was around 3-4 years of age so far this tablet has survived everything except the constant draining of battery when used by her . I believe it depends on how you want to use it. I bought this for my young kids and they are loving it. They can do basic stuff like surf the internet, watch youtube and play some games. The only complaint that I have is that sometimes it does not charge, even if you have have it connected for the whole night. You just have to restart the pad so that it can charge, but that is the only glitch. Works well. I really like the bigger screen (up from the 7\"). Easier to read, just as easier to use if not better. This tablet is great for anyone who uses this for the basics.Load times can be a bit slow for browsing the web or streaming videos, but once it\\'s loaded, it plays without buffering as long as you got internet speeds that are good enough. This tablet is a good size and great for pictures, downloaded videos and music. For its price, it makes a pretty good gift for someone wanting their first tablet. Bought one for the kids to use while we travel, lots of good free games. Installed VLC media player from the app store and filled up the SD drive with movies. Now they are nice and quite for hours on end.Battery life is awesome! Can\\'t beat the value on this. 5 stars even though it has less apps than the play store. I bought my Fire HD8 as an alternative to carrying around my laptop and having to buy many textbooks for college. The fact that I saved well over $150 on one of the 5 books I had to get this semester was a godsend. Most all undergraduate courses I have seen are offered in eBook form for Kindle. If you do not care about having the constant ability of being on the internet without WiFi or other hotspot, it\\'s a great resource. Pros:Price for this was still less than the money saved for my Biology Book.A lot less weight that 5 college textbooks.So far all books I need for college are available as eBooks through Amazon.A single charge can make it through an 8 hour school day.Cons:If you want/need a network connection, you have to use your phone as a hotspot or connect to another WiFi network. Bottom line, I wanted a cheaper alternative to having to lug over $750 in books around. I came out at well under $500 considering I bought this. My only disappointment is the inability to download some of the apps I use in my phone. I had the previous model which was fine for reading but a little slow for other things. The extra .5 RAM makes a difference. Very happy and if you\\'re a Prime member there are lots of freebies! I like this tablet. It has everything you want. However the apps within it need to be updated more often. If this happened than it would be top above an iPad mini. For now, it gives me enough of what I need and in HD. For $89 it was a good deal. Great inexpensive tablet for everyday use. It\\'s not powerful enough for super graphical games but it\\'s great for basic apps like surfing the web, emails, news, etc. Amazon has \"underground\" apps which is totally free (including in-app purchases). Only downside with those is that you sometimes see a full screen ads in them (usually products that\\'s on your Amazon wishlist). All-in-all, it\\'s a great tablet that you don\\'t have to worry about if you break it. Great price of 89 dollars on a great tablet. It is very fast at everything accept game play. For example it plays asphalt 8 and the game is just barely playable. The graphics struggle on this tablet with higher graphic games. Also it is a Amazon tablet with no Google play store but you can load Google play on to it. There are great you tube videos on how to put Google play on a amazon tablet. The screen is good as long as the sun isn\\'t hitting it. The stereo speakers sound great and loud. All in all I really liked the tablet for the price but I really like to play games with good graphic quality. So that being said I did return this tablet and ordered the Nvidia Shield 8 inch tablet through Best Buy for 199 dollars. I got the Shield a week ago and WOW!! What a difference in graphic gaming quality. This thing is just as good as an Xbox1 or ps4. The Nvidia Shield tablet is simply unbelievable for the price of 199 considering the Apple or Samsung tablets that are as fast as this tablet are at least twice the cost. Plus this dubbles as a gaming console for xbox or pc games with 4k out to you tv. The Amazon tablet is also a great tablet for normal usage but if your a gamer like me the Nvidia tablet is the tablet of choice hands down period!! I don\\'t know why bbuy kind of hides the Nvidia tab only on their website and doesn\\'t sell it in the store. If they displayed it in the store. This would outsell the Apple or Samsung tablets. I hope this helps thanks. I find this fire much lighter and very easy to use I use this primarily as a reader; however, it has a smaller number of unread books that are not in the familiar \"carousel\" as in other Kindle readers. As a tablet it is faster, brighter and more clear than other tablets that I have used for internet purposes. I would recommend this product to anyone who uses a tablet or a reader. Does great on browsing and doing research easy to use and love the features especially the private browsing a great price as well Great little tablet for a great price. I keep it at work for listening to music or some lunchtime reading. Wanted to travel without my laptop. Found the Fire to be perfect. Used it mainly for checking email and keeping up with Facebook posts of friends. Found the size of screen to be easy to read. Typing a tad uncomfortable until one has some experience using it. Have yet to use as an ereader. great tablet to replace kindle. Love the features. This is a great tablet for my teen. She loves it and the price can\\'t be beat! This is a great tablet. It has amazing storage. I use mine daily. Great for reading, surfing the web and games. The one small thing I don\\'t like is Amazon prime shows are a bit dark for some reason. Hulu and Netflix work wonderful. The kindle is great to read on. I also like that you can play some games. I love the amazon tablet very much and love to use its good performance and highly recommended to amazon users I bought this for my wife to replace her 7\" fire that was having a hard time holding a charge anymore. She is thrilled! It was easy for her to transfer all of her books and apps from her old fire to this. She mainly uses this for books , email and some games so this is the perfect tablet for her. better graphics and quicker with the 16gb storage If you don\\'t want or need something cheaper than an iPad but of quality, this is a great happy medium.The processor makes for a fluid ride with it. It\\'s speedy. The Android Store gives you good app options and the Amazon ecosphere is everywhere here.The software is a touch buggy but it\\'s still a great deal of a tablet.For a child, for something you want to use casually on a dime, it\\'s recommended. Easy to read. Light in weight. Has many good features. I read about this new 8\" Amazon tablet in the New York Times. My Google Nexus 7, 4 years old, was getting slower and slower, and I needed to upgrade - for as little money as possible.This Amazon Fire 8\" is an excellent value for the money(only $89!) - very fast, great screen resolution, and easy to use. I was skeptical of the Silk browser, which I\\'d never heard of, but it works fine. There is no \"page forward\" arrow, which is odd, only backwards, but I can live with that.It has exceeded my expectations and I\\'m very happy with it. I\\'m not in the Amazon ecosystem, this is my first foray, and it\\'s a good one! Congrats to Amazon for making an affordable, great quality tablet!Also, the purchasing experience at Best Buy was easy and convenient, as always! The new Fire HD 8 is an improvement over the Fire HD 7\". It is faster and the larger screen makes reading books much easier. I do wish the screen was easier to read when outside or in the car. Too much glare in those places. Love it! I\\'m not computer savy but was able to figure out most things without any help. Mother needed something since her tablet had died. Was lot easier for her to learn than her old table. She does lots more with Kindle than she did with tablet Light to carry and good picture quality. This was purchased for a hearing impaired person to download video in American Sign Language . This product was easy to maneuver for someone that was not use to a tablet. I love this tablet. I purchased them for gift and am so glad I did! The new Fire HD 8 tablet is a nice upgrade over the previous version. Storage doubled to 16 GB and the RAM increased by 50% to 1.5 GB. This makes the tablet faster and more responsive. With the improved battery life and much lower price, this is a great general purpose tablet. I purchased it for my dad (70)He needed something easy to use. He really enjoys it. It a great product..,. The quality is awesome the pictures is good and clear... i have had not issues with my purchase. i found a great cover for it on line on amazon and use it every night. thank you for your service. This has a great picture, good size, lots of storage and a camera. Would recommend I went from the 7 inch Kindle to the 8 and it really made a difference. Easier to read and clearer than my old one. I love this Tablet. It\\'s easy to use, a great price & lightweight. This is my second Kindle Fire HD. I was satisfied with the first one, but now I\\'m really enjoying the larger screen. My biggest need is to preserve the progress I\\'ve made in various games without having to replay them, but at least I have access to all my books, movies and games. Love the Kindle! Love the product. I use it every day for Web,Games and reading. I bought this to replace my wife\\'s (1st generation) Kindle Fire. She likes it even better than the old one, especially the pinsharp screen. Great Kindle fire, works great for reading, playing games, etc. Highly recommend to everyone. Very pleased with this device. Great price, easy to use, and light weight. Nice upgrade from my old kindle. I like it very much. For the price this is perfect. I read books, search the web, watch Netflix. It\\'s not an iPad but for the price it is amazing! İt is cheap tablet option coming from amazon. Latest model will satisfy your needs Very descent for a non-IPAD. Good speakers. Great price. The screen is a little dark. Great buy if you have Amazon Prime since you can download stuff and watch it offline (great for trips, etc...). Overall great cheap IPAD or even as a back-up tablet. Terrific battery life too. This thing looks nice, runs nice and feels nice and for the price I don\\'t think you can find a better tablet. Got this for my 9 year old after her ipad crashed and burned. She does not like androids at all but I couldn\\'t afford a expensive tablet for her. So we took a chance with this one. She is pleased and I\\'m pleased it seems so sturdy , not cheap quality at all. Going to get our youngest child one now. Very pleased. The quality of display is better than expected for the price. (Keep in mind that this is not an iPad!). Apps from amazon are well integrated and the functionality is fully enjoyable without limitation. Very satisfied with the product. This review is for Fire HD 8, 16 GB. I like it but I had a hard time figuring things out.Do I get to talk to geek squad free? Can I come down to the store and get someone to help me with my questions.Will there be a fee for that service? Beautiful HD resolution on this tablet. Love the 8\" size, not too big nor too small. This is an awesome tablet, fast, great display and has all the apps I need for personal entertainment If you look for a great tablet for entertainment this is the best you can have, if you want a tablet for working applications this is not the one so be aware and buy this tablet if you want tons of entertainment. also it have a larger processor and internal memory and the external memory to keep all your photos is unbelievable I strongly recommend it, again, not for work but for entertainment. I bought 2, 1 for each kid. Easy to set up and figure iut. I went with the staff member\\'s recommendation and I am so glad I did. I love the internet safety organ on it through Amazon. $2.50 a month per kid for unlimited age related and child safe Internet access and movies, books, games and apps and I can set the time it shuts off and a minimum time for them to read each day. Love love love. Good tablet, great price, easy to use, pick up simple Very happy with my kindle. Would buy it for my kids I am a power user; there\\'s no other way of putting it. I work in IT and I research the heck out of products before I buy. I had an iPad Mini 2 that was just not up to snuff with iOS 10 so I sold it and bought (and eventually returned) the 2016 Fire HD 8. First let me say it\\'s a great tablet for the price and for probably 50-60% of tablet users who surf the web and watch Netflix. It also helps if you are a heavy Amazon content user. For me, I was spoiled by the retina display on the iPad. The 720p display is alright, but you can see the pixels. 189ppi is pretty low by today\\'s standards. The other big thing for me was the lack of a laminated display. It\\'s glare city on this thing. Display nitpicks aside, it punches above its price point. If you don\\'t play really heavy games (which it even plays Titan Quest surprisingly well!) and you don\\'t mind not having an absolutely beautiful screen I think it runs and works fine. It just wasn\\'t for me. I bit the bullet and went with a 128GB iPad Air 2 as its on special at BB for super cheap right now. This is not a bad product. Amazon offers greats products but this tablet was missing features even for a basic tablet. The lack of google chrome compatibility made this tablet not right for me. So I got my Fire HD 8 originally for ebooks since e-copies are much cheaper. Very easy to use, especially if you are not tech friendly. So glad I got this. This was a good tablet. I bought it for my Gf who basically only wanted it for Netflix and YouTube. The display was good, not great. The issue we had was that it kept dropping the wifi connection. This could have been a defect in this one tablet but we returned it and got another one. Bought the Kindle for my daughter. It\\'s the 4th we have bought over the years, one for each child. Great product GREAT value for the cost - not as fast as a high end tablet, but certainly faster than I was expecting. Clear viewing and easy navigation Husband loves the 8\" tablet. The screen is big enough to view what he is reading For first tablet I am pleased. An amazon name is good value. Excellent price point for my basic requirements. It has all the features I need for comfortable reading of online novels and articles. This is a good product for the price. Many more things can be done with this fire 8 than we dreamed about. Easy access to my Amazon account. Easy to set up and use. This item has a very nice readout, and is well built as far as I can tell. The overall size is very suitable, and the price was reasonable. I get great service at Best Buy every time I shop there. Does everything I needed and moreI use it as a travel companion and the size is great. Its so perfect for my niece & she loves it. Going to get another one for my son. the performance is so much faster than my old one and the graphics are much better too. Love my kindle it does everything I wanted I to do. I wanted a tablet that was easy to use that I could access my email, internet and stream shows/movies! It\\'s perfect! As expected. I am very happy with this. This serves the purpose Handy to use and size is good. It\\'s light weight and that\\'s important. I got this for my husband birthday and he loves it This kindle is great. Battery lasts much longer than old kindle. Where do I begin...good clarity, I love the size and storage capacity! Very affordable, love watching Netflix on it. I do wish I could have gotten the purple, got the color black, but overall I\\'m very happy with my purchase. I didn\\'t think to much of it at first glad at the store, I decided to purchase it. IT WAS THE BEST DECISION EVER MADE I bought the Fire HD 8 & CaseI use it mostly for class..works very good..would be better if it had BlueTooth. We have several kindles and this is the latest version. Its packed with Amazon marketing stuff which is fine if you use them but most just take up space for us. This new version comes with 16gb but allows you to expand the memory with an sd card which is great. One problem if you have a few other kindles is that they are linked to your account so if they are for different family members/kids they may end up with the same stuff on them. My kids mainly use them for game apps and YouTube videos which am seem to work great. The sound is good and the hd video is nice. Overall happy with it and the price was good for this type of tablet. I went into Best But to buy another reader but ended up buying a Fire 8; good value and has the things I need in a reader. Got the tablet for my grandson he\\'s happy with it and use it as we speak We bought this earlier on line from another vendor and it was never delivered. Best Buy was great. Great buy. Bought it for my 10 year old niece. She loves it. I have always gone to buy a kindle because I like the books and th games available. But I found them very unpredictable and unreliable. The color burns futon screen, then the screens starts jumping. As a result I have purchased 8 over the years. Not sure if Want to go through that for the 9th time! It\\'s good, saves using up data usage on computer. I use it to keep up to date with the news. The Kindle Fire HD has a larger screen (8\" vs. 7\") and images are crisper with more vibrant colors. Just lock the card out and let the kids go crazy!! This is an awesome tablet perfectly for watch tv for my little nephew My kids enjoy reading books and playing games on the fire tablet. I\\'m so glad i brought this because it is very handy and easy to use too. Everything about it is good and I really like it. At the price it is almost an impulse buy. I wanted a tablet for an upcoming trip to watch some movies, read, etc and this was at a price point that made the decision really easy. If you are used to an iPad, the Fire HD is a little disappointing but it costs considerably less. It fit my needs but I felt some slugginess and several instances of needing to reboot to get certain apps to work correct. If you go in with the understanding this isn\\'t an iPad replacement this should fit the bills for you. Let\\'s just say, after my trip I purchased an iPad Pro and this item will likely be handed off to one of my children. If you have Amazon Prime, you do get some nice perks that make this a really nice item. Easy to follow directions allowed her to set it up with me watching over her shoulder. I purchased this tablet for my Autistic child. He loves it!! I\\'ve enjoyed using my Fire HD8 tablet to play games. Beautiful screen, vibrant color, fast and best quality for the money. I use it for downloading and reading books. It is the perfect size for this purpose. It is also very light. Bought for wife who is not into the techie word. She likes it - suggest buying a protective screen and padded case for it. My wife wanted an iPad. I bought her this because it was cheaper and good for reading and playing games. She uses iOS products so it\\'s not compatible. She hardly ever uses it. Next time I\\'ll get what she wants and not waste my money. Much better screen resolution than my 7 inch fire. I bought this tablet for my Mom and she loves it. I used it myself and it\\'s very easy to use and works nicely with Amazon Prime, etc. definitely would recommend especially for the price. I enjoy using the tablet. I use it when I am biking. This really a nice tablet.It runs great and it\\'s thin and easy to hold. This tablet is quick and as good as my iPad! I use the tablet specifically for one aspect of my life and it performs great! I am pleasantly surprised by its performance! I have a 4 year old boy and 6 year old girl and 12 year old boy no cracks or broken yet yes they have dropped them no case but no cracks yet pretty amazing when they drop it on hard wood floors and still not broke!! Wow I\\'ve had quite a few different kindles over the years and I\\'ve loved all of them. But this kindle fire hd 8 is by far my favorite. So glad my husband bought it for me the best purchase ever. Upgraded from a standard Fire tablet. Better screen, a bit faster than standard Fire. In my opinion this the absolute best value on a tablet out there. No way to go wrong at this price the new sound and the faster speed plus other improvments are great I am very happy with this Amazon tablet. I purchased it for business purposes, as well as recreational, and it works great for both. I did get an SD card for more memory. Also, if I would have bought directly from Amazon, there would\\'ve been a 1 month wait. However, I was able to order from Best Buy online, and pick it up that very day!!! Its perfect to see my tv series when i don\\'t have my tv around. It has a very good resolution quality. I bought the 8\" to replace my old 7\". I love the bigger screen Freeze frequently... No way to trouble shoot or repair it... I got myself 1 of these tablets and so far I love the way it works You can enlarge the print and change the lighting to make it easier to read. The only thing with it is you must have an Amazon account to use it. This kindle rocks! Tons of storage at an awesome price. bought it as a gift for my mother and she loves it I love the fire....it works great and the navigation through the Fire is user friendly too. I think the 8 is the better buy for your money. BY FAR THE BEST TABLET IVE EVER OWNED, EASY AND QUICK SET UP This tablet is very good especially considering the price. also has memory slot to increase storage. I bought this tablet over the holidays when it was on sale. It has been a great tablet. The battery life is great on these new models. Also playing games everything moves smoothly since it has more ram. The durability of the tablet is great. This thing won\\'t break if you drop it. The only thing I don\\'t like is the fire os. You can\\'t get everything you can get on the google store so not all apps are available. I have had a few kindle\\'s in the past so this was nothing new for me but what I loved about this one is that the screen is big so when I am reading a book it\\'s a lot easier than when I had the first kindle screen. I mostly use it just for the reading but being able to navigate the internet on it is great for when I want to look something up about the book real quick or if you want to search reviews on a book before purchasing. I love it! Purchase this tablet during the Christmas sale. This tablet is a good tablet for a beginner. Easy to use and shows movies and videos very well. Great tablet for on the go. Good size screen to watch movies or read book. Light, portable and great features. Highly recommended. For the price and features offered on the tablet, I wouldn\\'t purchase any other tablet. I enjoy using it and overall find it fairly easy to navigate. Easy internet browser with \"Silk\" and convenient access to all the applications I am interested in. Bought it for a friend he likes it.would recommend it. This tablet was everything I was looking for: a cheap tablet that could download Netflix shows for offline viewing Unlike my first Kindle, this tablet gives me all kinds of information, advertisements and offers when I first turn it on. I could live without that, but overall, I am pleased with this new tablet. It does many things I haven\\'t taken the time to explore, but hope to soon. This is a great tablet for the price. Would give it 5 stars if it had included some sort of instruction manual. Otherwise, definitely recommend. This is a great tablet with great features. I love my kindle. Can\\'t beat the price on this tablet! Great for streaming or casual games. Great for reading and Netflix. Fits nice in purse. Good price. Good value at a very affordable price. Can\\'t beat it. Works great prety fast operating system dosent heat up We love this so much in our home. We bought a super tough case and let our two and six year old use it. They love watching their movies on it and playing different apps. It is a really good value! Great tablet! Brought this for my wife and she loves reading off of it! Great price, easy to use! Great purchase! Very fast, very functional. Love the e-reader function. Movies, music and internet work great. LOVE IT! I received this as a gift from my husband. It\\'s great for reading, gaming and watching Netflix. I exchanged a highly unsatisfactory Insignia unit for the Fire. I was looking for a 10 inch screen, but went to the smaller size for performance. I have no complaints with the Amazon product, other than the ubiquitous advertising. My daughter loves her tablet. I had to make sure I brought a case because it is very thin. No problems and I can see everything she downloads Have a fire 7 and wanted a bigger screen, love the new one. Perfect for our needs and an on the go mini computer and ereader. This tablet is great for books, audible books, music and all things Amazon. The included browser (Silk) is not the best. I purchased expanded memory (64GB SD card) for about $30 more and a cover for about $20. The biggest issue I have with this unit is that it is slow (when compared to an iPad) and it tends to freeze every so often. For about 2.5x more money, consider an iPad instead. Great tablet use it for reading and email. Great price! Nice little tablet. Functional and easy to use.Fits the needs that I need to use it for. Awesome.and repeat 50 times. That should do it. Blah. I initially bought the tablet for school, I use Kindle to rent books but after using it to stream Xfinity, Netflix, and Amazon Prime I loved the sound and picture quality. I would recommend this to anyone needing a good low cost tablet with great battery life. We have had no issues with this tablet. Love it!TY For the price it\\'s a bargain. This is a perfect solution for a reader and simple browsing. I use this at night before bed. My first tablet experience and it\\'s awesome. I love being able to stream movies and have numerous apps at my fingertips. Bought this for my wife and she loves it! This was our third kindle over a period of many years\\'Can\\'t go wrong for the price. Love this tablet. Power lasts long. Short charge time. HD screen is really clear. Only con is that there are some apps not available like Google play. Very satified. Have a 128gb card in mine . Plenty of space for downloads. The camera has no flash and is not the best but I didnt buy this tablet for that. High recommend the HD tablet 8gb amazon fire. You want go wrong. This tablet does all the things I really need. I have it some thought before buying I don use most of the features a more expensive computer/tablet has. Have been very happy with my purchase. Got this for my wife\\'s birthday. She had an older model and wanted an upgrade. She seems very happy with it and uses it every day Very user friendly...long lasting battery....very clear display Worse graphics, won\\'t keep a wireless connection,overall not satisfied Easy to transfer my stuff from my old Kindle into this new one. Love the price and how easy it is to use. Great buy. This is my first kindle. It works great for my use. Mostly reading, email, and Amazon shopping. Amazon Fire HD8 is one of the best deal at 89$. Strong, efficient, low price and some Amazon features that I love. Youtube videos of how to get googleplay and android apps have made things lot more easier. And now, microsoft office is available online for free that I can access and edit my documents. What else do I need? Amazon is more respectable brand name than other low price brands or used/old models of high price brands. Definitely recommend it. I held off getting a tablet and wish I had done it sooner. The Amazon Fire 8 is great and easy to use i have been looking at tablets for a long time, most of them a little expensive for what i would use it for. This tablet lets me read, email, searches and the best part I can buy books through amazon and not have to carry heavy books with me when i travel Not the highest quality of tablet out there, but for the price you almost can\\'t beat it, especially if you are an Amazon Prime member. I liked the screen size and easy to read books at night. The battery has a long life. The outer rcase could be stronger because concerned about durability. Works great for everything we want our daughter to do it\\'s wonderful. I love it. It\\'s easy to watch movies, play games and read books. love it just like my other one just better!!! since I already own a kindle I knew this was what I wanted. Just needed a second one and a little bigger. Always loved the service and help I get at BB so I knew I would purchase it there!! Found salesman to be knowledgeable and most helpful. Thanks so much for your help and service New Kindle replaced my old Kindle that had a lot of books. To my surprise the book transfer worked well. Seems to work surfing the net. Music sound is only okay. Great little device that does almost everything a Tablet does. I use it as my computer when I travel as well as a reader. Has meet all my needs plus some. Recommend you buy a good stylus pen at the same time. It fits just right in your hand. Light weight. Love it I extremely happy with my purchase. I like that the screen is just a little bigger and much faster. Good picture, works well, great variety of apps. keep in mind that you get apps from amazon, not google play, so they aren\\'t always the same or same price This replaced my old Kindle Fire. I have not yet explored all of the features but, so far, it is performing very well. Tablet is a good size and weight, and easy to use. This tablet has been the best one for the price we have purchased 3 other tabs for our kids and they have all broke and ran super slow they love them would definitely recommend this to anyone who wants to save a buck but want quality I would recommend this product it is a good tablet to use have had no problems. Kids love it, under $100 so the price is great. Don\\'t have to worry about it getting mishandled as much. Still can\\'t get them off the ipad though. I went with this tablet based on many good customer reviews, but my experience was not a good one. From the start I was on the phone every day for at least an hour with Amazon tech support for one issue or another. Most of the techs were very polite, but not all knew the product very well. At one point I asked one of them about trying to save some RAM and they kept referring me to the storage, which told me they didn\\'t even know the difference between RAM and regular storage. The internet browser was basic and it ran very slow at times, even when all my other wifi devices ran great. Then a day would pass and I\\'d be trying to type an email and the keyboard would just stop working...wtf??? Come to find out it\\'s a \"known issue\" and \"they\\'re working on it\". After two weeks of one thing after another I got fed up and just returned it. I wanted it to work, and gave it a good run, but just not quality stuff. To me it was like Walmart trying to build their own computer when they\\'re obviously not a computer manufacturer, neither is Amazon. If I were you I\\'d look at a regular Android tablet from a reputable PC manufacturer, which is exactly what I did next. I got an ASUS tablet for only a few dollars more, and it\\'s unbelievable. 1000% better in comparison to the Amazon Fire HD8. Save yourself the aggravation and go with ASUS or some other company that is specifically in the computer business full time. Sorry Amazon, not this time! Not very fancy, but not slow. If you have Amazon Prime, you have a access to a great library of TV shows and Movies for free. Same goes for free book rentals. The Amazon App store is not so great, lots of apps are outdated but still work. Just not the latest versions you would expect. But the Amazon Underground appstore does offer free access to games you would normally pay for. It\\'s decent for it\\'s price and a good deal if you don\\'t want anything fancy. I love my Kindle fire. Had a Kindle and it disappeared. Enjoy not having to go to library for books. I get a great selection of books every day. Light weight and easy to use. Very user-friendly. Durable. For the price the tablet can not be beat. I use this over my ipads that i have. There is nothing i cant do with this tablet I recently upgraded to this tablet; it is everything I wanted. Highly recommend! It was a good buy and tried this for a day. It was fast and experience was good. I purchased this tablet knowing exactly what my needs were and how well the Kindle could meet them. Despite the \"walled garden\" philosophy that tethers you mostly to Amazon products and services, the ability (as of right now) to side-load the Google Play Store makes this a surprisingly versatile device for the price point. This is a great tablet for the price! I bought it to replace my iPad mini. Great for ereading and general browsing. This replaced a Kindle 7 HDX with 32GB of ram. The older tablet had a charging port that wasn\\'t functioning anymore. Had the Geek Squad warranty so they issued a full credit for the old tablet and my son chose the HD8 as his new tablet. Other than the screen resolution being lower and less memory, great tablet. My son didn\\'t care about the resolution and the new Kindles let you pop in an SD card for more storage. Popped in a 64GB SD card and he\\'s a happy camper now.. ;) I purchased this as a gift but have had extensive time with it. It\\'s a great budget tablet, phenomenal screen and a very smooth interface. Handles all apps and HD content well. This was a birthday gift to my husband. He really likes it and it does what he needs it to do I \"retired\" an earlier version and this new souped up model more than meets my needs, and the battery lasts so much longer!! I have a kindle and wanted more options. I love the bigger screen. I find it easy to read. It can have some reflection under lights but not much. This tablet is easy to set up, has great resolution, and is perfect for reading books or surfing. The price is affordable, too. It is perfect for anyone who wants a fun and casual way to use technology. This was bought to replace my old Kindle with keypad, and experimental internet. Was surprised how much the Kindle had changed, and at the same price as my old one was when I bought it!Have already shown it to a couple of friends who now say they are thinking about getting one. Really enjoying my new tablet. I like to travel and me and my family use it to play game and watch movies. Just the right size to. Liked this Kindle upgrade. The color screen and backlights allowed for easy night use I enjoy the new kindle, only things I would like to change is the way screen darkens and lightens while reading. Not sure how to stop that. Occurs consistently. Also, would like to stop the ads seen each and every time kindle is turned on to start reading again. That is bothersome. Otherwise, am happy with the kindle. I purchased the 8 inch device. Also purchased black cover.I played for it and asked if I could get it set up and was told it would be 40 more dollars. I did not have 40 more dollars so I left the store with my kindle and had someone else set it up for free. I was disappointed I had to get someone else to set up my kindle. My previous Kindle was dying and I wanted a new replacement fast. I went to Amazon and while they had one it was back ordered a month. Expecting to pay more I went to Best Buy and not only found it for the same price but even better it was available at my local store and I could pick it up the same day! I got this for my son to play games on soI could get my iPad back. Personally I think it\\'s a great little tablet for kids and or for reading. Other then that it\\'s not a high powered game playing tablet or anything to keep lots of storage on. But it works for what it\\'s intended for andI have no problems. Easy to use You cant beat it for the price you pay This Kindle is larger than my old one and book reading is much easier. Some features I don\\'t use so can\\'t comment on them. All in all I love it.The only drawback was that the store had no covers that fit this Kindle. We purchased this as a replacement for our now-broken iPad. Though we liked the smaller size (more convenient, easier to carry, etc), the internet was sooooooo slowwwwww that it drove us crazy. Sometimes minutes to download a site (and this with no other apps open!1). Plan to go back to another iPad. Tablet is great and easy to use thankfully because its my 1st tablet This is an item that is easy to use for novices. My child uses it and has no issues Easy to use. Pretty user friendly. It is good value for the price No problems with tablet, kids love it and the size is great My nephews love to play with my phone. Now as anyone who has been around small humans knows they have an astounding ability to perpetually have something sticky on their hands. However, if its a rare case where they don\\'t they will probably drop the device from the lack of said stickum. The kindel has come to my rescue as it has everything they need to be entertained. And best of all it lacks the anxiety inducing price tag for that moment when the kids demonstrate Murphy\\'s law in action. Was a present for my 14 year old grandson. He was very pleased. The Kindle fits me to a \"T\". Very quick to start. It shows how to get things done. For under $100 this 8\" tablet is a bargain. I do all I want on it like; check email, Facebook, Twitter, watch YouTube, read books, and shop on eBay or Amazon. I\\'ve been very pleased with my purchase. Bought this for my wife for our anniversary she loves it I love to read and this tablet work great for my needs. I know beforehand that this is not a powerful tablet. But it\\'s the best bargain at this price point . The screen is okay if you just read books, news, or surf the websites. But if you want to enjoy videos-this is not your choice.The processor is slow and the amazon app store doesn\\'t have all the apps like you\\'d expect from Google appstore- even though the OS based on android. But few tweaks let you install the Google playstore-search online for the steps.Overall I\\'m satisfied with my purchase. Hope this is helpful. I bought it for my grand daughter, she knew how to use it right away. You can purchase a rubber case in different colors for protection. It is just an average tablet. Bit slow but is a good option for people on budget Very nice for reading and watching videos. Strong wi fi is a must. Slippery to hold so buy a cover Tablet stopped working after owning for two weeks. Came back on after an hour. This device is great for the price! I use it for my daughter and after having seeing the ads on amazon, I thought this would perfect for her. I think that the Amazon Kindle tablet was a great purchase for my teenage daughter and grandson, very easy to operate. It kept them entertained for hours while we were traveling on the train for vacation. Great device. Works very well and use it throughout the day.Keeps me informed and great for looking up things and staying in contact. I love my kindle, I can listen to music,read my emails, or pick a book to read. Everything loads up easily. I really enjoy my new kindle, still getting used to it. I have done this like 5 times now. Don\\'t send me this ahs8n. Getting aggravating. This is an affordable tablet and works well, you just have to deal with a lot of advertising. Love how I am able to run the latest Minecraft on this device, but am not able to on a 3-year-old iPad. It seems as apple handy cap their devices. Resolution may not be the best, but for the little buggers it works fine I love my Fire HD8 I got it because my Kindle(the original) that my husband bought me died and the Verizon Tablet wasn\\'t working great for me. So I came down and the agent at store showed me this one, there is a learning curve but it gets better and takes a while to learn but I love it. Does all the basic stuff I need at a great price. I use it for some apps, web browsing and some video. Picked this over the Fire 7\" for the screen size, resolution and CPU/GPU. Battery life is pretty good. Ads aren\\'t too annoying.Far cheaper than competing name-brand budget tablets while doing almost everything needed at this level and probably better supported. FireOS will always be a little behind the current Android version and I\\'d rather have Google Play than Amazon, but this still allows for side-loading stuff.Recommend if you\\'re ok with living in Amazon\\'s world and/or proficient enough to load other app stores or packages (or know somebody can). this item work just as I expected it to, great product! This is the third Fire we\\'ve purchased, and Amazon finally made this level memory-upgradable. That has made all the difference. I bought Fire tablets for use as a \\'kid tablets\\', for which they work great...until you run out of memory. 8GB is practically nothing these days (I remember when having 64kb was a HUGE upgrade to my Atari!) so being able to toss in a memory card give my kids much more utility. Have a nook , this is much better has more apps and thru amazon I love the size and the HD quality. Just what I was looking for!Downloads apps really fast! Never thought a tablet at this price could be this good. Totally recommended! This is my sixth unit and has features many of the newer models didn\\'t have. Thank.............................................. I had the original kindle fire for ten years and I loved it. But it broke on me and I decided on this one after looking at all the upgrades from the original. It let\\'s you do so much more, but some of the tutorials (like for the internet) weren\\'t helpful. Lightweight, nice display and not too large to carry. this is the perfect size for an older person who uses it minimally. Good tablet, satisfied. One point annoying...silk browser makes Yahoo email a list and have to tap HTML to read each one...Awkward. I love the apps that are on here and everything else I think it\\'s the perfect tablet for a beginner has all of the apps that you will need Love this tablet. 16GB memory but have expansion slot. Bought 128GB micro SD card for $56. Love this feature I love Amazon Fire HD8... It is so easy to use and perfect for reading books on or cruising Social Media. I love that it has Alexa included on it. I love my Kindle for reading manga and comics. The fact that the graphics are worse than my phone detracts a little from the expirence, but serves to remind me that I cheaped out and bought yesterday\\'s model. This is not a real negative, it just appeares less crisp than my phone. The increased picture size more than makes up for it in my book. This thing lasted not even a month before it went dead. Going to try and take it back Bought this so the grandkids could use it. They already have one at their house. My husband has been using it also & he likes it. He has never used a tablet before but he has enjoyed it. This is a fantastic tablet for the price. This is a great alternative to an IPad. I had an original Kindle that I replaced with this newer one. I love it!! My 8 year old loves this so much to do on it. She enjoys reading on it play games . I purchased this tablet for my 9 year old son and he loves it. Nice bright screen and has two speakers for pretty good sound for a tablet. Great for games and watching videos. This was purchased on Black Friday as an impulse buy and we absolutely love it! It was a great price and the size of the tablet is perfect. It works great! Great little tablet for someone who is always on the go. I love my tablet no regrets the pic are great I recommend it! It\\'s a great item to have when you are out and about. It\\'s easy to connect to Wi-Fi and it\\'s small enough to fit in my purse. Nice product for the price. It does what we need it to do. Easy to use and handy to have with you instead of a heavy laptop. This was a surprise when we opened it up! Bright and colorful!! Nice look. Great memory and camera. For this much money everything is so good. Bought this for my niece for Christmas. She mostly uses as ereader and checking email. I\\'m happy with my purchase is all I can say. The only complaint I have is that the 3.5 mm Jack is right next to the volume button and it gets in the way. Good tablet for the price. Nice display good performance. Loved my first kindle so the upgrade to the new one was practically seamless. This is I think the best product I\\'ve bought. I already own eight that I\\'ve purchased through the years for my family and they seem to only get better and less expensive in price. I have been completely satisfied with this product. The quality of graphics is great and downloads are a breeze. I would definitely recommend this product. I bought this as a present for a friend, and he uses it all the time. The HD screen is crystal clear, and this tablet competes well with the bigger names. My dad is a first time user for anything techie he has really enjoyed it. If you enjoy reading you will not find a better device. Excellent price for a product of this quality Bought this for my great granddaughter for a gift. She loves it and it is easy for her to use Was bought for a Christmas gift. My 11 year old son loves it. A friend of mine was in the market for a new tablet. I had researched the Fire tab for some time and liked the specs, which met her needs. I decided to buy her one for her b day, SHE LOVES IT! Works great with all the Amazon stuff, like Kindle, Alexa, etc. My kid enjoys the tablet. This one is inexpensive than ipad. The availability of apps are limited. I love my kindle, it is what I like to use at the end of the day or for business trips. The only annoying things are the amount of advertising the put on this version. It was only $35 for Christmas so I can\\'t complain. im always using my amazon tablet...perfect for games!!! Great price. Fantastic gift! I would recommend this for a gift for all ages. I love to read! Having the Kindle Fire is like having hundreds of books at my fingertips! Bought this as a Christmas present for my wife. Reads it all the time! Great all around tablet. Color and resolution is very nice. Best price for a nice product. Bought for my son as a birthday gift and as a way to not wear out his laptop. Works great especially for videos and general online use. This was an impulse buy. While getting a bigger, faster and much better tablet for my wife I decided I\\'d get this for myself. It did the job just fine, but after about a week I returned it. I just didn\\'t find myself using it wnough to warrant keeping it. The price is awesome and if you don\\'t mind it being a bit slower than other, much more expensive, tablets then I don\\'t think you can go wrong. I use this all the time. So much better than bringing out the laptop. This tablet is definitely recommended if you are looking for light to medium usage. Tablet is snappy and quick but slarts to lag after installing multiple apps.Amazon app store is good but there are few essential apps that are not available, though you can install them using black market. Nice it all ready has Amazon and apps built in. Great buy. Bought this tablet for my wife and she absolutely loves it. I also use it for school which works great with writing notes directly on PowerPoints So far so good. This is replacing a broken kindle fire. Bought this for my husband. He has really enjoyed it. Great for my son. I monitor school work and apps he downloads. I love my kindles. This is the 4th one. The others I wore out. I enjoy this one the most . Easier researching things , lot more options etc Very good value tablet. Does everything pretty well. Brightness isn\\'t great. Battery takes a while to charge but lasts forever. Decent buy. Would recommend. Really enjoy my kindle. Fits perfect in my purse and the screen is a good size. I bought this for Christmas for my husbandand now I \\'ve had it for months. I am still happy with this purchase. It has a nice screen and is easy to see what you are viewing. I will be buying another one for myself soon. I really like the feel and ease of use. It\\'s a great tablet for the price. This is a great tablet. I was surprised at how efficient and easy to use it is. I bought 8 of these for gifts to make Bible study easier for a bunch of friends. We purchased this for my wife\\'s mother. She likes to play games on it and do some reading. Needed a new Kindle. Wasn\\'t sure what one to choose. This one is GREAT! This product is OK but is not the best you can get. for a sale item fine. battery life seems to be a little short. Bottom line.....So so So far I am extremely satisfied with my purchase. Great product for a great price! I use this while underway and it\\'s a perfect size to travel with Love it. Great gift. Awesome for those who don\\'t have a tablet or never used one Works great with my amazon prime account and for browsing Internet and playing game. Cheap tablet as well. Had it for about a week and now it won\\'t take charge, tried new chargers and still not taking charge. Happy with tablet but unhappy about not chatging Overall I think the Kindle Fire HD is a great product. No complaint so far. I am extremely happy with my purchase. The kindle is very fast and the screen is clear. Great tablet, fast & reliable. Only downfall is having to pay to remove adds. It all of a sudden has stoped charging I have only used it a few times in the short time off purchase. Can I get a replacement or how best can I be helped The Fire HD8 tablet is so easy and fun to use. Take it everywhere. Love that it is easier to see than a cell phone, for those with old eyes. My wife\\'s mom wanted a tablet. This was a great way to get her into technology and she LOVES it. Not iPad or galaxy but good start. I purchased b/c my old kindle fire finally bit it ...screen went dark. Very happy with this one. Cost is great. The screen resolution is great. User friendly. My favorite feature is the SD card so you can add more gb. Bought it for my daughter. Works great Store personnel did an excellent job This is a reliable brand and a good product for price. Our son just LIVES this unit. He has all his favorite games on it. I bought this kindle for the extra size. I have recently been having trouble with seeing clearly so I figured with the size it may be easier. It was and I really like being able to change the color of the fonts and background, it seems to help immensely. Great budget tablet at a great price. Long battery life and high quality display. I traded this in after receiving a 7\" at Christmas and I am happy I did. I love the size of the screen for reading my books (which I have too many of) and a great size for watching movies. I do wish I had the capability to use internet when I am away from home, yet other than that, this is a great buy. Overall I like the Fire HD8 tablet, hard to beat at that price point. Sure the more expensive tablets are faster, brighter, better, but for the money and casual surfing it is just right. Good companion to Prime Membership, wouldn\\'t be half as good without. This is great tablet. Its great for people who don\\'t need a lot of apts. or store a lot on it. Doesn\\'t over heat. Light weight. I was going to get a Samsung tablet but for doing everything this is better amazon tablet is great. no google bloatware. everything is amazon. one thing i didnt like was. ads on the lock screen and no way to turn off. Bought this tablet to replace a 3 year old Galaxy Tab. This tablet is quick and easy to use, relatively streamlined. The screen is nice and the stereo speakers, while tiny, sound better than my old tablet. The modified Android system that Amazon is running on this tablet is good, just a bit restrictive. All in all a good tab for general browsing and popular apps.Pros:-Price-Performance-Feels sturdy-Easy to navigate-Silk browser works greatCons:-Not all apps are supported on here, like Telegram-Ads on lock screen feel unnecessary, but not a hindrance-Not as customizable as other Android tabs I needed to replace my old reader, and found that this model was just as good. if not better, and at a greatly lower price. I have enjoyed using it for about a month, and am very please with it. I didn\\'t expect anything less than what I got with this Kindle. Bought this for my daughter to replace a worn out ipad. She is happier with the size. The resolution is nice. Great buy for the price This tablet could be so much better if the apps actually worked decently. The built in Amazon pieces for Prime members is great and work flawlessly. But it\\'s not enough to overcome the terrible app behavior and countless freezes.  They need to take a lesson or two from Apple. I have only used this a few times so far, but I like it. The lightweight and pretty easy to navigate. Perfect screen size too. I ended up purchasing a second one for my fiancé. The size of this table is great I\\'m able to carry it in my purse with no problem! Really nice customer first service. I have had other Kindle readers before so was familiar with the unit. I bought this tablet mostly for watching movies. I downloaded movies from Netflix and watch them during indoor bike training at the gym. I love the ability to expand the memory with a microSD card, which iPads do not. It\\'s pretty fast and has all the features I need. I read kindle books with it as well. The drawback is that some apps are not compatible with this device. The iPad is definitely more powerful and compatible with many apps I use, but this is a great tablet for most of my current interests. Before the 8 inch kindle we the old 7 inch one, which both tablets are great but this one so much nicer. The screen is bigger, more storage amd Love the color on the back. Great Tablet I\\'m enjoying the longer battery life, faster processing and most of all the ability to expand the memory. Highly Recommended! She loves it . it\\'s the best thing we could of ever brought her Bought this tablet for my son and he has loved it. It\\'s so easy for him to use and easy for me to set parental controls. Nice little tablet for the money. A few ads to deal with. I use it to read books. Have read a lot of books on it. The right size and lighting for any situation. I bought this for my computer loving 89-year-old dad. Now he can check his emails from his chair rather than having to go into his computer room! Bought on Black Friday for $60, add a trifold case, portable TV while I do dishes/cook/anything Got this when it was on sale which is what really made it worth getting. Tablet works well, slim design is perfect. Highly recommended to purchase this tablet. Perfect purchase for me. I take it everywhere and is so easy to use! Purchased this a couple of weeks ago, no complaints so far. Web pages load pretty quickly on the Silk browser, and the battery life is excellent. After installing Google Play Store (it\\'s really easy!) even more apps are available. Can\\'t beat this for under a hundred dollars!!! After having a basic Kindle for 6 years, I moved up. I am thrilled with all this product can do. I am an avid reader. The Fire let\\'s me do that and lots of other things. I am still finding apps, and other things it will do. I know this sounds \"old fashioned\", but it would be great to have a user\\'s manual! Thanks for asking. Bought as a replacement kindle for my mother in law. She loves it perfect size for her. This is my 4 the Kindle and is well worth the price. My wife loves this tablet.Much easier to use than previous 2 tablets that we purchased. It\\'s great!! Light weight! Charges quickly! Great features! Will not seem to charge all the way and this is my 7th Kindlle. Nicer than my old fire. Better screen area to view My husband and I both use this and really love it. We got kindle unlimited for the books but it\\'s also great for playing games and surfing the web too. Love my new Kindle Fire - easy to use - the battery life is amazing!! Perfect size for reading watching movies and carrying on a plane I upgraded from a 7 to an 8 inch. What a difference. Totally satisfied would recommend this to everyone I know and it out performs some of the bigger name brand tablets out there. if you looking for a good video and somewhat customizable tablet at a great price do not pass this up. If you need a basic tablet then the fire works. It falls apart when compared to the iPad mini from a usability, functionality and available apps standpoint. Worked great but after awhile I wouldn\\'t unlock. After I\\'d enter my pin, the screen would go black. I took it to geek squad (luckily I bought the protection plan!) and told me they don\\'t fix them they just replace them. So I got another one but that one did the exact same thing. Ended up returning that one too. seems a lot better, does not have the open cover feature, which I miss, but still getting used to the differences and trying to get my thing back on that I had on the old 1 Really easy to use, nice size, works great, affordable price, extra card slot for storage, bright screen, good speakers, easy to download apps, This is my third Kindle. My sister bought me my first one and I said I didn\\'t need it and probably wouldn\\'t use it. I was so wrong! I use it everyday. When it died, I bought another one and then a third. I can\\'t live without a kindle. I bought the kindle fire 8 for my husband and I to use. Neither one of us have been able to figure out how to use it. Every time we open it advertisements pop up. And we just try buttons to remove it. We cannot get it to rotate for our puzzles. Just too complicated to use and to navigate around. I will be returning it. We have an iPad and it\\'s much easier. bought this for my niece and it works perfect, she easily navigates all menus and features... An inexpensive tablet that can satisfy your reading and viewing pleasure. Fast and good quality product. Recommended! Bought this for my 2 yr old. Easy to use. Good parental controls. As long as you\\'re not comparing it directly to an iPad, then it\\'s a pretty good tablet for the $$ like it at first, but it is going slow sometimes. overall good product We bought the tablet for our kid and it actually is good for her. Great little tablet to take with you, great for kids Only problem is that it is impossible to read or do anything on the KindleFire with any light in the room at all; far worse than impossible in sunlight. There should be some sort of temporary screen or other add-on that can be used with the device when in sunny or bright locations. I like this and the price is right enjoying it now I Bought this as a gift for my daughter! She is diabetic and losing her vision. I am hoping the large text will be easier for her to see so she keeps reading. I have ordered a couple of these for my family members and say that they work great and do everything that they are supposed too. Highly recommend. I have a nexus 9 but it is painstakingly slow so I wanted something that does not lag Everytime I try to use the browser and does not freeze whilst playing games and this gets the job done very well. The battery life is also very good. Highly recommended for casual browsing and games. Great tablet, only thing needed is a better camera. However, for the price, it can\\'t be beat. Lightweight, performant, and packed with features. This device is great for reading, music, or movies on the go as well as web browsing and email. Easy to use, like lighted screen for reading in dark Better than I expected for the price. Works good and I would fully recommend I am very satisfied with this product. It performs extremely well in all areas of its operation. We bought one of these for my daughter to help with her learning. There are so many possibilities with this. It\\'s way cheaper than an Ipad and does basically the same thing. I absolutely love my Fire tablet. Great size, lots of space and a great reader. I can\\'t recommend this product enough. I like this tablet, its thin, light and easy to use. It\\'s great for kids and adults as well. Have been pleased with my purchase of the Fire HD8 as it\\'s video quality is great when viewing ESPN3/Netflix/YouTube Tutorials.The ability to easily load and read my saved textbooks within the Amazon Kindle App is fantastic for a fraction of the price for an IPAD. : ) The first Fire HD8 we purchased died within 1 week of purchase. We had to go back and exchange it for a new one. Not a good sign so far. I I bought this for a friend since she liked mine so much.It is a great way to check emails and read Kindle e-Books.I keep an SD card in mine and store my books on it. You can just drop this in your purse to read on the go. Husband is a first time user, he is doing really well with it.. He has low vision problems and this made reading his favorite books a lot easier to read. It\\'s actually a very good product for a decent price. Not lightning fast but it is okay for everyday use. Love customer service very knowledgeable and helpful Very good tablet for the price economical and the ability to carry in backpack I bought this Kindle for my husband\\'s birthday. I have had a Kindle since 2013 and I used it mostly to read and check emails while travelling. My husband is not particularly a book reader, but he spends way too many hours alone, in his office, reading his face book messages. Now, with the new Kindle he actually multi-tasks, in the living room, on facebook, email, and internet, at least in proximity to me, so he might even join me in a conversation! I think his Kindle has much imporoved our 35 year marriage! It is easy to use. It was cheap. Have not found anything about it that I do not like. i really love this product because it lets me read books and surf the net Love this tablet. Bought it to be my touch screen remote for my harmony hub, but use it for so much more now. make sure you buy a micro sd card with at least 64 gb of memory. or you will have to constantly delete old items. This is a good product but the one I bought stops working after three or four typed sentences and the Geek Squad guy told me when I brought it back that I had to go into settings and clear the data when it does that. WRONG ANSWER. That should never have to be done. He had no idea what he was doing and North Haven Best Buy didn\\'t offer to fix or replace my Kindle. This is the third product I have had to go back and either return or exchange because it wasn\\'t working properly or at all. One manager tried to excuse the store by asking me if I understand Best Buy doesn\\'t actually manufacture these products. If that is the best they can do to explain why they, as the Point of Sale, keep selling defective products, the North Haven store has a big problem. like the speed the 8 inch screen is great. Works well. Up and coming new technology helps everyone to enjoy life more greatly This is the perfect tablet for my purposes. Easy to use and the perfect size. Not too large and not too small. This device is s really good piece of electronic. It is a good reader and also is very good for my 2 year old granddaughter to use. For my son as a present for college books. 5 textbooks were 1/4 the price on kindle than if we bought them on Amazon, this is my third kindle. Other two still working great, I bought this to replace a 7\"fire hd tablet that broke. Amazon changed the operating system so it took me a while to figure it out. I set this up for my son with special needs. I tried to make it as simple as possible for him. It is a little bigger. The sound isn\\'t as good as the previous fire tablet. It also seems very slippery. I got a rubber honeycomb type cover for it. That seems to help us to grip it better. Over all, it\\'s a good tablet for a child. Just use parental controls, and get a good cover for it. Reciever of this really likes and and says its a step up from the fire hd7, so I guess that is what counts. My bf got me this as a birthday present from my son. It\\'s just like my 7\" although larger. I cannot tell the different between the regular and the HD and I game on it. I\\'m not sure if it cost more, but wouldn\\'t waste the money if it did. Noticeable improvement over the fire 7 inch. If you\\'re a first-time tablet owner then the fire 7 inch is a great device. But if you\\'ve owned a tablet with higher specs, there is a noticeable improvement with the fire 8 inch . The Fire 8\" has a better display and faster processing. Very satisfied for $39.95 sales price. Way faster than I expected. I purchased this for a small child to use. She is quite happy with it, however it was a little too slow for my taste. My new Kindle is an upgrade from my 7 year old Kindle Fire. As to be expected the video quality is better along with faster performance and more features. I still use my old Kindle as it is still ticking but the \"shiny new toy\" is fun. This is the second Fire tablet that I have purchased. The first I returned in after I was not able to load YouTube onto the tablet. Amazon\\'s take on Android was just to unfriendly to make it work. With this new tablet, Amazon has heard my concern and now I\\'m enjoying this tablet. It\\'s well built for a sub-$100 device, but won\\'t stand up to a lot of abuse. Reliable, price efficient device. Easy to use for all ages. I can play games, surf the internet or watch movies. I can check my e-mail or just about do anything I can do on a regular computer.I strongly recommend it. This is a terrific tablet at a great price. The quality is excellent, the price is right, it has tons of storage capacity. And oh, did I mention that it\\'s cheap? (Cheap for a tablet, that is.) Had a great experience with my Best Buy rep! Great Job! Small, portable and very easy to use. I have not had any issues as of yet. I purchased this product on a whim with a very limited purpose which was to study for an exam while in the middle seat on a long flight. I expected to hand it to my 10-year old after my exam. The surprise was that really enjoy the device and in particular I like the Amazon account integration: On my next flight I was delighted to find that the unit actually downloads my videos for offline viewing! The best part is that I upgraded the memory with a 64GB SD card so now my available content is awesome! Truth is that my first unit inexplicably failed but Best Buy replaced my unit right away and I expect great things with this new device! My son also uses it on long trips!!! I bought the HD Fire 7 for my wife,I liked hers decided to buy the Fire HD 8 for myself I love it.Nice graphics easy to use. Able to download music and movies free!!!!!!!!!!!! I have used the Kindle mostly for reading. I have downloaded books from Amazon, some free some purchased, that I have heard about for years and now will read. I have also read Manga from the Internet. My use of the internet has also included looking up gardening hints, animal care, and dog breed characteristics. Need to have some computer savvy. Wound be much more helpful if it came with a simple basic instructions. This was a gift for my son and he loves it. It not only helps him with his homework but he could also play games on it! You cannot top the value at this price point with any other tablet. The only reason I give it 4 stars instead of 5 is the limited app selection through the amazon app store. If this came with the google play store, I would give it a 5 in a heartbeat. Overall it is a great tablet at this price point. I would highly recommend it. Great for my mom who isn\\'t tech savvy. Luv it! :-) Very smooth tablet no lag at all also good battery. Love the kindle will continue to buy them for my family awesomeness, love how i xan watch my xfinity movies This tablet is not only a great price but exactly what I needed for quick Internet access and to download books ! I purchased the Amazon Fire HD 8 to replace my 2nd generation Kindle Fire. It works great and the colors are sharp. The 8 is bigger and lighter weight than my old 7 and the battery life is longer. It also has more storage and a camera. Love it! I lost my tablet in Germany and wanted a replacement fast. Best Buy, had both the 7 and 8 inch Kindle fires in stock, after reading the reviews, I decided to go with the 8 inch. Boy was I glad that I did, the larger viewing area, is great for watching movies and Netflix on the airplane. The 8 inch has stereo sound , unlike the 7 inch which has only mono. Overall I am really happy with this tablet Pros - HD quality for low price. Works really well with my Amazon account to access multiple Amazon features with extreme ease. Couldn\\'t be happier. I have iPads too which are extremely versatile but they came with a big price but not this tablet. Love it! We bought this one and a black one for our kids. It\\'s very durable and good price for the quality. For myself personally, I still prefer my iPad, but if on a budget, you won\\'t regret the investment. It\\'s so simple I sometimes struggle using it. The free time experience is awesome for little ones and I can set parameters, which is a huge bonus. For a first-time tablet user, this is a solid product. A very good product by amazon. Considering the price, even better. Good for watching movies, reading books and playing games but don\\'t expect to do much more. Everything else can be a challenge and it can get laggy and once in a while it\\'ll just shut down a program or completely reboot. Excellent product. I would definitely purchase again. After using this tablet for a while, I have found that I even prefer this size over my iPad Air. Easy to carry around and long battery life make this my preferred device. The screen is just the perfect size for my older eyes, the screen on the 7\" fire is just too small and cramped, and it seemed a lot less responsive. I highly recommend this sweet tablet. This was a BIRTHDAY GIFT for my LITTLE one and she LOVED it! I purchased two of these as Christmas presents for my children. I had been researching child friendly tablets with robust controls to keep them away from undesirable content. I found the 7\" Fire Kids Edition, but after looking over the specs and reviews, I found myself unsure of it. I was mostly interested in the FreeTime application, so I did some research on that and found that it was available on other Fire models also. I came across the new Fire HD8, which had more power, a better screen, and far better battery life at a very affordable price point. I gave them a shot and I\\'m glad I did.I have the Fire HD8\\'s locked into FreeTime mode, so the only activities that can be done are ones that I approve of, but if I want to, I can pick up either of them and unlock them to access Netflix/Amazon Prime or anything else I desire. I currently have reading goals set up that they must achieve before they are able to access videos or games, and those are limited to X amount of time per day. FreeTime also has a bedtime feature which disables/enables the use of the tablets during designated times, which is amazing.The hardware itself is exceptional. The screen resolution is excellent, it\\'s very responsive, and the battery life is spectacular! They advertise up to 12 hours of battery life, and depending on screen brightness, ours last almost that long regularly. The only con I can think of is that the cameras are sub-par, but that\\'s not what I purchased the tablets for, so it\\'s a non-issue for myself.Some of the reviews I read cited that the internal storage was easily filled with FreeTime content, so I installed 128GB SD cards in them. I also purchased some rugged children\\'s cases for them off of Amazon.This is probably one of the best purchases I have made in a long time. The sound of silent children reading all day is priceless!!! I bought this tablet for my sister to replace her kindle. We love it except for the fact it would not connect to ATT internet. I suspect this was an ATT problem. The internet could not be authenticated. Since we have had problems with ATT for seven years, I am sure it was a problem with them! Once my sis read the instructions, she was good to go! Great tablet for a kid enjoys very much would buy again Overall, very impressed especially when compared to my iPad mini 4. This tablet does it all and makes for an excellent e-reader, while also boasting specifications that rival any iPad. works great for us for video calling, for kids watching videos My wife loved her gift. I made the right purchase. I own two Amazon fire tablets with this one being the same as owned.. My sister in law wanted a tablet and since I owned one just like this one I figured it to be a good buy.. She just loves it, she is able to do her scheduling, read books and watch her news programs.. It\\'s a great Alertanative to an iPad... great price and just as powerful for a lot less cost.. These Kindle Fire tablets simply can\\'t be beat in terms of value and bang for your buck if you have an Amazon Prime account it would be a crime not to have a Fire tablet.Good strong build quality, very nice bright screen with a strong picture and good resolution. They are pretty responsive, have good battery life and can handle the abuse of letting your kids use it as well. We bought this tablet for our son in college and he loves it. This is my first tablet and it\\'s going well so far. I purchased this for reading and streaming. There have been a few hiccups with regards to a streaming video buffering for a long time and sometimes I have trouble with response on commands, but overall, I\\'m happy. It\\'s been a nice device to have for reading online material offline. Replaced my hd fire 7 because broke screed. Very pleased with the large screen. My only dislike is that being a Kindle, my Kindle books cannot be sorted into categories. It\\'s harder to find new books I\\'ve downloaded some time ago when I have to search through all of them. Purchased as a gift. The receiver loves it and said that it works nicely. Purchased this for my 80 year old mother in law to replace her old cracked screen one. Everything was perfect easy to use and set up. She has zero problems using this for online and reading books. Love it I sent one down to my family in Mexico they loved it Bought this as a gift for my mother. She absolutely loves it. Easy to set up and use. and the price was right. I am loving this tablet. My previous tablet was a 1st year Fire. This tablet is great for reading, games,facebook and emails. This is my third Kindle and I have loved them all. I still have my first Kindle and use it. I just wore my Kindle Fire out with 5 + years use. I am very happy with everything my new one can do. No disappointments at all. I got this for my husband for his birthday. He likes the light weight and the speakers and how powerful it is. Got it for my Dad. Easy to use and he loves it. Good stepping stone for future producs One of the best purchases or investments you could make for technology. I bought it for kindle books and was amazed by its overall features. Its Kindle with features of a TAB. I bought this primarily for reading, but, being a tablet it is able to do so much more! I can listen to music, download movies and check email. I love it! Way better than my Nook! Great tablet for price! Fast, works great, great sound volume, great pixelation and screen size I\\'m new to tablets but this one is pretty easy to understand and use.There\\'s a decent amounts of apps at start up, which can be good and bad. i would buy this item again. however charging port is so far. A few not so great things, modt of them managed to resolve them though. This is a nice little tablet and Great for the kids Not a huge fan of products that aren\\'t Apple but this one is good. Haven\\'t had any problems with them at all. I bought this for my sister as a gift so she need not use her laptop for basic internet surfing and to watch movies while travelling. The device speed is decent although you cannot compare the performance to a laptop. If you want to avoid carrying a bulky laptop during travel and want a budget make do device for laptop then choose amazon fire tablet. I got this tablet for my mother and cousins. It\\'s been very speedy to my surprise, not as fast as a high end tablet but no lag and a very nice 720p display with good build quality. Would definitely recommend if your looking for an affordable tablet YOU PAY FOR THE BEST AND YOU GET THE BEST. THANK YOU BEST BUY FOR PROVIDING THIS PRODUCT I have an older Kindle and enjoyed it very much. However, there is so much more improvement in this tablet with faster processing speed, upgradable storage and longer battery life. I\\'m really happy! This was the perfect tablet for what my husband wanted. 8\" size was not too big or too small. You can carry it without it being clumsy to drop. I love my kindle.It is user friendly and there\\'s so much more than I thought. Great little tablet after you add google play store. Takes some research to do. Awesome tablet and great value for money. My son is enjoying it a lot. I bought this as a cheap alternative to an old, slow, iPad 2, until I could spring for the iPad Pro. Got it as a Black Friday deal, so it was more than worth it. Was able to add some missing apps that make it even better than I thought it could be, and having Amazon Prime makes it an inexpensive and handy media device. I carry it in my bag at all times without having to worry about it\\'s value. Can\\'t beat it for the price. I love to read! Books,books, books and more books. Longtime Apple user, but for this price vs an iPad you can\\'t beat this product! Easy to use. Great picture clarity. Wish they had a cellular version. I got this because it was a cheap tablet. It does great for watching videos from the tablet and sound is good also. I don\\'t like the amazon ecosystem or app store. I wish they would sell android tablets with their apps on them like they are doing with their phones. This is a good tablet to own. I like the features. My son needed a tablet to take notes on at college classes. He wanted something small and lightweight instead of taking his laptop. He\\'s found it to work perfectly for what he needs! the first worked fine for three weeks then stopped. took back and got a replacement. this one lasted almost a month. again took it back and was told I had to deal with Amazon.Found out thru Amazon webpage that units simply froze up and how to reset it. Was upset that store associate knew nothing about the product. Had to research everything myself. purchased for my sister for reading books, internet and games - perfect for beginners and novices. Easy to use. Would be a five if available with 4g Love the added space. Easy to move around in. I am excited to use all the new features. Gave as Christmas gift,and wife loved it. She has not put it down since she has gotten it. I love this new Amazon Fire HD. I have a 6 year old and I\\'ve set it up so that he has his own password and he loves to read all the free books available. The different shades of back lights are cool. If you purchase the new Amazon Fire HD, it will enhance your reading experience. I decided to buy this instead of a traditional kindle and I do not regret my decision at all!The only con (for those evaluating this as a tablet) is that Amazon has their own App Store. Many apps from GooglePlay/AppStore are simply not available. We had an old Fire and upgraded to the Fire HD. Love everything about it so far. The fire tablet is a great tool for reading, surfing the web, playing games and even watching some Netflix, on a bigger screen, without killing a cell phone charge. Great value! This tablet is great for everything. It\\'s not as powerful as an iPad but the price can\\'t be beat. I like that it is a good reader and that you can also put some apps on it -- I use it to check email, one note, etc. but primarily as a reader. Got this tablet cause I wanted to start reading more graphic novels and manga and was very impressed with it it runs smooth and even use Hulu and netflix on it. My only flaw with it is that there are ads on your lock screen though you can take them off for $15 other than that it\\'s a grade little tablet! My wife wanted this and I got it for her. She has been totally happy with it. She loves it for its size for reading online books. I am very pleased with my purchase the tablet is a great project is there a product is very versatile Great tablet. Easy to use. Will recommend it to others. If you\\'re looking for a small but effective tablet that\\'s reasonably priced, this tablet is the one for you. It\\'s easy to understand the directions, therefore making it a snap to learn how to work the tablet. It comes in different colors and is easy to read and use. Give it a try. Thanks, Best Buy!!! Very competitive Price - Unit works well we like color and size The HD8 and HD7 are amazing for the price. They aren\\'t top powered tablets, but they\\'re functional tablets. Right now, in Feb 2017, either one is a good replacement for the Nexus 7. Bought this for my niece and she loves it. Very easy to use from what she tells me! I really liked the build quality but the very lackluster performance and minuscule battery life didn\\'t make it a keeper for me. Such a a great tablet that does everything, love it! I am an avid Amazon user for shopping and tablets, I bought a different model for my younger brother and now purchased this one for my grandparents and they love it! I purchased this for my parents who were always viewing facebook or other videos on their cell phones, this Amazon tablet is perfect for them! It\\'s user friendly and if you have an Amazon Prime account has great access to movies and music. I\\'ve had iPad mini\\'s before so this tablet in my opinion can\\'t compare. However, that being said. I bought this tablet for the purpose to watch Netflix and read books on. In my opinion it handles these two task perfectly. The screen isn\\'t as clear and crisp like other tablets but hey I didn\\'t pay $300 for it either. I like this size and it seems fast. I\\'d have to say I like it a lot. On another note, I\\'m giving this review only 4 stars because i am absolutely annoyed at Best Buy and their shipping. This is about the 3rd time I\\'ve ordered a product and had it shipped to me and Best Buy said it would be here at a certain date and UPS screws It up every time. Don\\'t have any issues anywhere else but always when I order from Best Buy and have it mailed to me. Anyways, the tablet is good for the price and I\\'d recommend it over any other lower end teblets. I bought one for my 9 year old son for his birthday - and now we are buying another one for our ten year old. We have had some tech issues as we are juggling three tablets on one account - but with careful monitoring, it\\'s ok. Wonderful little buy! Tired of my bulky tablet. This one stays charged a lot longer! Nice tablet with the slightly bigger screen, great for tv, movies and reading especially for older eyes. Good size as well, it fits nicely into a purse or tote without being too heavy I like because I can download movies to watch offline with netflix I bought this tablet for my mom on her birthday recently. She loves it and uses it all the time. I always wanted a tablet and finally decided on the amazon fire 8. It is awesome and I love it.I downloaded some games and I am enjoying them. It is great for internet too. Definitely worth the price. You get a lot for the money. It had lots more options too. It was okay, but most of my apps were stripped down versions on the HD-Fire. It was inexpeisve, but you get what you pay for. The O/S is pretyy premitive. The hardware does fell nice. I would say it is the perfect device for an older or younger person. ok for price a little slow and doesn\\'t have as many apps as google play. I have owned several kindles. I don\\'t know what I do to them, but they tend to die rather quickly. Thank goodness for Best Buy\\'s extra protection. The last two that quit on me were replaced quickly and effortlessly. Excellent customer service as well! Love using this Kindle to look up real estate sales, play mind games, and take pictures. Love the bigger screen and the great resolution. Sound is also far superior to my older model Lindle. Wife loves it. She said it opens much faster and likes auto updates for apps. Super easy to set up and use :)Got one for daughter and got one for self!!!!!! the tablet is great, but all the advertising is annoying This Tablet does absolutely everything I want! I can watch TV Shows or Movies, check my Mail, Facebook, Google.......pay all my bills. It processes fast and has a beautiful screen. As I said: Everything I want in a Tablet for less than $100! And she has been happy about it ever since. Not being that tech saavy, this specific device has a user-friendly tutorial to help get started. Got this to replace the Samsung tab A 7\". That Samsung tab lagged a lot but I haven\\'t seemed to have as much problems on the fire tab, the only downside is that the battery dies fast. I have had a Samsung Tablet for 3 years, and I have to say that I love this Amazon Kindle 10x better. The picture quality is amazing, it is light weight, it is easy to navigate. Great tablet, great screen, great price! Very user friendly, especially for a not so Tech savvy person. This is as good as my my Ipod! I would recommend it Needed a new tablet for reading books, movies and surfing the Web. This meets all my needs! Great upgrade from Kindle Fire. Reasonably priced for product. I would recommend this to my friends that you can shop on amazon has many preloaded games. Many Apps Great Product and great Price! Love it i would recommend to anyone who is looking for tablet on a good price Simple and easy to use!! The wife takes it everywhere! Easy to use! Just plug in and search for your favorite movies and TV shows. I love my new Fire HD! I had one of the first generation Kindle Fire, and loved it, love this one even more!!! I didn\\'t do any in depth research on this particular tablet. The price and speed were good for what I wanted it for. My only con is not being able to clear the home screen of apps or relocate them so I can see my personal home screen picture. I gave it as a gift to a friend who is a senior citizen who had an Amazon Paperwhite. I thought this would be a lovely upgrade for her and it has been. She loves it!! Great device very functional love it will recommend Bought this for my Father-In-Law for Christmas and he loves it. Easy to use and has already bought 5 books for it! Can\\'t say enough good about it. My 10 year old loves it. Enjoy the Kindle, fun games, can access the Internet, read books, etc. The tablet works just great and the price can\\'t be beat! We did get this when it was in sale for about 50$ and for that this is an incredible value tablet perfect for anyone who wants a screen without paying premium prices. Build quality is fine and screen isn\\'t the best but definitely usable. It\\'s not a regular tablet but I just use it to use Facebook The screen is clear and tablet is faster than i expected. Great colors also! Not the most powerful tablet but is flawless when utilizing the Amazon programs Bought this for my elderly mother who was wanting the ability to read and/or listen to books. After a slow start getting her going (she is not tech savvy) she is really enjoying the versatility of this tablet. Although it does not have cellular data ability, which she had no use for, it gives her the flexibility to connect to wireless networks when she makes her weekly casino visits. For the price it can\\'t be beat. That being said I had to return mine after a week. I just couldn\\'t get over the low resolution screen. It works well for movies and the Web, but I needed it to also show off my photos to others. This was a gift to a friend. So far she loves it.. Books and magazines are easy to access and read!!! Bought this for my 8 year old in place of a Nabi that didn\\'t work out of the package. Great basic tablet for this. As I reviewed different tablets, this tablet kept coming back as my best option for the items I was looking for. It IS a great tablet, but there are a few things I don\\'t really like about it. I didn\\'t realize that Amazon has it\\'s OWN browser SILK. Everything even your banking info goes through Amazon. Not sure I like that. Also, items don\\'t automatically close out when you leave a page and I have to frequently hit the button on the bottom and close out multiple items. It might just be that I am not THAT computer savoy, though I do know how to navigate my way around. Sometimes the touch feature just seems to freeze and won\\'t recognize that I am attempting \\'touch\\'. Lastly, the on/off button is right where you hold the tablet on the side, so I am often \\'accidently\\' shutting it down. Most annoying! Overall, I am happy with my purchase and for the price I like it. Just wanted to point out the other items. serves all my needs in a economy tablet and I would reccomend it to all. Good product with best price available in the market place Tablet is a great tool to use the world wide web and check email. works great, wife loves it. Always happy with the kindle Has a few quirks that are disconcerting bur overall a great product. Only a few quirks when it comes to this Kindle. Better quality sound and display. Great tablet. Picture is super sharp and so easy to read. I picked this tablet up for a 5 year old grandchild as a way to learn how to use a tablet works fine . We previously bought a 7 inch, 8 GB Kindle for my son which he used a lot. Eventually though he dropped it and it no longer worked. This past Christmas we purchased the Amazon Fire HD8, 16 GB.This model was an improvement over the previous one. With twice the internal storage, my son wasn\\'t always coming to me to delete games because he ran out of storage. Another great feature is the external SD card slot. We bought a 32 GB card and he\\'s not had to delete anything.The quad-core processor is a big improvement over the previous gen model. Apps and games load quickly with not lag in running them. There also seemed to be an improvement in the battery life so it doesn\\'t have to be charging all the time or plugged in the the power cord.This is a great purchase for any child! Excellent product.Relable.Maximum speed.Fast downloading Love this tablet. It\\'s big enough so I can see. It works with my prime so I can watch movies or stream music. I purchased a Kindle a few years ago and Have loved the flexibility it give me. I can browse the internet without moving to my desk to get on my personal computer. I love the fact that I can continue to read my books while I travel. Doctor Office Visits seem to just roll by more calmly now because I can ignore the office chatter and the TV selections I rather not watch. I encouraged others to make the purchase and several have done just that. This is my second purchase. Love It! I purchased this for my mother and she has been going on about how wonderful the Amazon fire is. It\\'s the perfect size easy to use and she can even do her banking on it which she loves. I would definitely recommend the Amazon fire thank you This is my second kindle. I love using them for reading, web searching, etc. I download some of my favorite knitting patterns, so when on the road I have something to work with.I love love love this kindle. Bigger screen, slimmer and lighter. Great tablet just what my wife wanted, loves the wifi, much better than her old one. Was a gift and they love the tablet! Its a great price and works awesome! The amazon fire tablet 2016 is quite good. It provides sufficient content & ability to do all of the basics one requires in a tablet. The 8 inch screen is bright and provides various settings. The tablet\\'s light weight makes it very portable. Need to buy a tablet for my Mother as a Christmas gift. Functionality is great and she uses it for all her online needs The Fire HD 8 is the perfect size EReader. Big enough to see the text but small enough to hold comfortably. I bought this Amazon Fire HD8 as a Christmas present for my wife. It is the second tablet I have given to her over the past 5 years. She LOVES it! It goes wherever she goes. The Fire is more than portable and so easy to use. As the saying goes: \"A Happy Wife Means A Happy Life\". I wouldn\\'t hesitate to recommend the Fire to anyone! Gave this to my daughter for Christmas. She loves it. Uses it every day. Good buy! I use it mainly for reading e-books and browsing. However, I wished there were more apps available. Also, before unlocking the tablet, ads are shown in the lockscreen. If the tab is locked, it stops streaming the ads. You can pay $15 to disable the ads permanently. I only recommend this for basic use. If you want to use it for games or other apps, I would recommend a stronger tablet like the ipad or samsung galaxy. This is my second Kindle Fire, and the only reason is because I upgraded. They\\'re a great little tablet. Very versatile and fast loading times. Definitely recommend. Good quality android tablet. also makes a very nice gift. I purchased this for my 12 year old and it was at a great price point. I like the parental controls feature with the multiple profiles. This allows me to control what she has access to which is a plus for me. Thanks perfect for my little kids they love this tablet good quality and fast enough for them Can\\'t say enough about the Kindle Fire. It literally is fiiiiiiyah... fast, easy to use, and an all-around perfect tablet. Recommend keeping an eye out for special pricing at holidays to save some cheddar, but otherwise I\\'d say pick this little black rectangle of portable interwebz awesomeness up the first chance you get. The best product for the money. East to use, great color, great features. easy to set up and battery life is great. This was a gift for a family member they really enjoy all the options of getting books I bought this one for 40$ during the black Friday sale, as a gift to my cousin. He was flattered by the performance, even I didn\\'t expect it to be this good! It works flawlessly with the usual games and apps, what you are going to miss the most is YouTube, amazon\\'s app store does not have youtube. Other than that it meets all my requirements for daily use. Best B It is helping them to learn to read and follow directions .Best Buy had the products and provided great customer service. Grandsons are enjoying product use. This tablet exceeds its reviews. its easy to use and the screen is great. My husband and I purchased the new Amazon Kindle Fire HD 8 tablets for our 16 yr old son and 12 yr old daughter for Christmas. I have an older version 7 in myself so I already knew we were buying a durable tablet. The new ones are awesome and they had them in colors so very easy to distinguish who\\'s is whom We purchased during Black Friday and got them for $30 off, which was an amazing discount and made me love it even more. We had shopped around many places prior to and. They are light weight and the screen is plenty big enough for them to watch movies, play games, do homework and video calls friends and family out of town. They seem to have plenty of space and nice to know that we can add memory if we need to.The tablets hold up to the everyday life of the kids accidental drops kicks and their 3 yr old sister lol. Would definitely recommend this product to anyone who is in the market for a new tablet for themselves or children. Will buy again in the future if these ever quick working. Bought it for my little grandson he likes games, he can play with it where ever there is wifi. the tablet was on sale for a good price, and they had enough in stock for the CHRISTMAS season> grand children were thrilled. Good tablet and a great price. I use it for reading, Netflix and email. good for beginners play games ,take picture and recording videos old the time Won the kindle fire 6 last xmas2015 at work raffle. Gladly got this kindle fire 8 for a bigger screen and better battery life. Love it. One of the best inexpensive tablets on the market. Great for the casual user Loving this tablet, 5 stars in my opinion, definitely worth it. Easy and fun to use. Also, a perfect size even for a man\\'s hand. Bought as a gift and they love it! Great for the price. I went in to buy my 88 year old Dad an Amazon Fire book reader....The customer service from the begining was great!. An Associate immediately approached me, showed me several models, with explaining them all. After picking one. I was then told of the \"free shipping\" of which i did utilize. My dad received within a couple of days , on his birthday, and was able to go to his local Best Buy, and have an Assocate show/explain how to use. He was sooo excited and pleased with the item and service....and so am I. Also, the price was right tooo! This is a great reading product. Love the light adjustment in low light areas. I can adjust the font sizes for my reading comfort and I can do other things like download apps or watch movies! i really loved my 7in. but i love 8.5 in. a whole lot.!!!!!!!!!!!!!thanks guys!!! I bought this 8\" Amazon Fire HD for my Wife as a Christmas Present. Her old 7\" Amazon Fire that she had for about 3-4 Years. She is very happy with the 8\" Amazon Fire HD. Can\\'t beat the price for a Tablet. My son loves it, he can watch videos, read books and play games. Excellent and inexpensive. ITunes store and Google Play store have more apps to choose from, but this is still a very useful tablet. Expandable SD micro memory a definite +. Have not had time to REALLY use it, but hope to download books and games. This is a great, easy to use tablet for the price. It\\'s a 16 GB mini-computer and camera perfect for trips. enjoying reading via the device; lots of options is also a plus; a little heavy to hold when reclining Needed a present for mom, at first she didn\\'t use it much cause she had to set it up but now it\\'s great and she loves it. Bought this for my 83-year old Mother. She loves it! We bought it two days before it went on sale for Christmas and Best Buy was excellent with price matching asesome!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! performs as designed got it on sale for 79 dollars Is great for my son 8 years old, they help with homework We own an ipad,samsug tablets and we have both love are fire8\\'s wave better. This tablet was affordable and it\\'s pretty decent. Bought this for my dad, he is 87. Very easy to use and setup. He loves it and uses it 3/4 hours a day At first was going to get a iPad but I decided to get this instead way cheaper then a iPad and just as good, love it.. Couldn\\'t recommend this more for kids. Price and features are awesome along with parental controls. The functionality is great although I wish it came in more colors. I didn\\'t actually use as I bought for a gift. My grandson already had one so we returned for a pair if 3-d goggles. use as a reader and music, games watches movies i good all round tablet Just thought we were purchasing a capability to download and read books, magazines, etc. But, for such a low price was surprised at the total capabilities available. I GOT THE FIRE HD SO MY KIDS COULD READ BOOKS , PLAY GAMES AND WATCH THEIR SHOWS . WITHOUT SPENDING AN ARM AND A LEG FOR THE TABLET. I THINK THIS IS A GOOD TABLE FOR KIDS / YOUNG TEENS WHO WANT TO HAVE A TABLET BUT NOT BREAK THE BANK. We bought one for my wife and my mother-in-law and they both love it. Very easy to use. My kids love it. Battery life is longer than others. This was a gift for my mother who is 99 years. She used to love puzzles, but with arthritis and failing eyesight she couldn\\'t do them. The puzzle app is good because she can see it and use finger to slide pieces. She can keep up with family on Facebook Very decent tablet. I was skeptical at first but it\\'s performance surprised me. Battery lasts a decent amount of time and connects beautifully into the Amazon ecosystem I already am in. Would recommend to anyone who likes to watch videos/browse the web on the go or for children. I purchased this for traveling. I can access my e-mail, books and games without lugging my laptop. I\\'m sure I will learn more as needed. Best buy was very helpful & the tablet is good for reading books & basic serfing This is a perfect size and weight. Everything is very clear, sharp and large enough to be comfortably readable. Word has it that relationships are interrupted by electronic devices. Well my girl takes her reader everywhere we go. She used to tell me I talk to much. Now I can hardly get a word in edgewise! This is smaller and lighter than my previous fire and works even better It\\'s not a $400.00 tablet so what can you expect, except that it does what it\\'s suppose to. It\\'s faster than I thought it would be so thats killer. So far I love this tablet especially for reading. The battery life has also been good Everything I expected with none of the drawbacks I have found in other tablets Works well. Probably best android tablet you can get for the money. Great tablet. No problems at all. Excellent Price. the only downside of it is that you can\\'t have google playstore on this tablet but you can still install it manually since they both based on android os I bought it for my mom after moving her into an assisted living place. . I was able to use it a little to show mom I was very happy with it. Seems fast and easy to use.i like it better than my phone . :) Didn\\'t get a chance to see how camera was yet. I love everything about my new kindle except for the fact that the charging cord is already loose. Great for those who love to read this tablet is always ready for on the go trips Bought the fire for my mother who is 72 to learn how to use a computer the price was right and she can use it to search the web I only have an older ipad to compare this to, but there is literally no comparison. The Fire 8\" tablet is lightweight, connects ultra fast to wifi, has an easy-to-follow automatic set up, and comes with tons of features that I\\'m only beginning to explore. I wasn\\'t expecting this at all! I\\'m a total convert especially because the price is so reasonable, too. This is a great Tablet. Love the features and resolution Super fast. Lots of storage. Great tablet for anyone. bought as a gift for Christmas. they love it!!!!!! This is an upgrade tablet from my first Kindle Fire that I purchased 5 years ago. Love the larger screen the quick processing and downloads, the great HD visuals, and most importantly all of my previous pictures and music files were easily transferred/accessed by this new device. Love that this Fire has a front and rear camer too, my old Fire only had a front facing camera. Granted this is not an iPad, but I don\\'t want or need all an iPad does. And I definitely don\\'t want to spend hundreds of dollars on a device just because it is cool. My Fire tablet does everything I need or want and it costed under $99.00. I am one satisfied and pleased customer. very easy to use I live my fire the best purchase I have made in months The only reason why I have not given a 5 star review is because sometimes, the unit freezes out of nowhere after I will be reading news articles or after watching Prime/Netflix Gift for Mom. This is her first tablet. She is having no issues so far. Great value for the price. Easy to navigate and has good picture quality. I bought it to watch Netflix, browse internet, read books on Kindle, and watch YouTube. Very nice tablet for low price. The shell feels a little on the cheap side but added a cover (Fintie) & feels much more sturdy. Great for reading or watching netflix or amazon video. Purchased this to get a lighter tablet. Also to update our my old tablet which had a replaceable battery. This is all around lighter ,thinner and easier to handle. HD is a good upgrade and can\\'t beat the price for comparable tablets with same features. my wife reads on it daily and loves it. I am probably going to search for another one.We have the 8\" and I would like to try a 7\" if it were available.I like to try different size devices to see how I adjust same way with todays phones. I\\'d recommend this highlyGreat buy for the priceGood graphics and easy to use. Good product bought it as a Christmas gift. I will be purchasing another one soon. Wanted one that played bejeweled blitz. This one does not. A gift to my 3 year old grandson. Great graphics and sound. The size of the Fire tablet gives you the feel of having a book in your hands while reading a book. Because of the size and lightweight it\\'s easy to transport and fits easily in my purse. I\\'m enjoying my Fire tablet which was a gift. The tablet is Excellent! Very fast and well worth the money! The display is great! I got this for my kid as a gift so he could read books easier and it has helped a ton! I got an 8\" windows tablet for my father in law and we quickly realized that windows is not a good choice for someone that is not already comfortable with all the windows features that are not tablet friendly. This tablet on the other hand, had a very easy learning curve and my father in law became comfortable with all the features in a couple of hours. I would definitely recommend it as a gift. The 8 inch Amazon Fire 6th edition is by the far the best tablet in the Amazon market. The 7-inch is a nice size, but the 8-inch has better screen resolution and longer battery life. If you are an Amazon Prime member, this is a must have tablet. Also, the Amazon magnetic case does a great job in protection and sleek-ness. I bought four of these for my kids and they love them Great tablet for my childthis tablet was just everything that I need it for my child Very easy to use and small enough to travel with. I slide it right into my bag. I would recommend this ereader above all others for its high quality and diversity. Not only as an ereader but as a web browser. I got my father a Amazon Fire he\\'s never used a tablet let alone a computer. So it was a challenge. He did pretty good but ha\\'s a hard time seeing the screen. I love my new Kindle Fire even more than my old one which I lost. Very good buy. I am enjoying my new tablet. Great buy! Learning all the aps that are on the Kindle, the games and all the free books. Perfect for a kid and it was cheap! My son has broke a lot of tablets, this one seems durable. I travel a lot and this is perfect for watching movies or reading on the flights The Kindle is great! It\\'s easy to set up and I\\'ve found all the books that I wanted. I got this on an impulse buy, mostly for my 16+ hour flight, but also just in general. Was in line buying something when I saw this at an unbelievable price! So I bought it and have no regrets! For the price ($69.99) it\\'s a great tablet, though you can only get apps through the amazon app store not the Android app store, which limits you. But that\\'s alright, as I mostly got it for watching videos and movies and that sort of stuff. And occasionally some games! Great tab and the price cannot be beat, Only gripe is the fire os. Oh well This tablet is great for the price. It has good connection to wi if. The kindle store is a breeze. The picture quality is good. And seems to be the perfect size. A nice alternative compared to The more expensive tablet. And much better quality then the less expensive tablets I would recommend I bought two Kindle Fires for my 4 year old twin grandsons this past Christmas. We downloaded lots of educational programs for them and they absolutely love it! No need to buy them an IPAD which was far more costly! I have had every version of the Kindle since the week it was introduced and jumped at the chance for a Kindle Fire. I replaced the first one I had in 2014 and it was everything I wanted except this past summer it started overheating and got nonresponsive in the midday heat. So...I got this one. First of all I miss Swype. WHY get rid of it? Secondly I cannot put two of my favorite apps (which work on my old one) to work on this but lastly and most importantly: every once in awhile the screen freezes with a bunch of code \"shimmering\" in the background and only turning it off and/or leaving it for awhile brings it back to life AND it turns itself off. It seems to happen when I close a program and move to a new one. Aggravating and not what I expect from a product with which I have been happy in the past. My granddaughter love this fire for al her games. We also downloaded a music app for her and she is so happy with this. So many things she will learn how to do on this tablet. Bought a Kindle Fire for my wife several years ago, our son is now 9 and he had kind of taken over the tablet from my wife. So we decided he was responsible enough and bought this for him for Christmas. I cannot believe the improvement over the previous Kindle Fire we own. The screen is more clear and bright and even seems more detailed, apps load faster, it connects to the internet faster. For the $89.99 they currently sell for I would say it is an excellent value. If you can wait, we paid less at Christmas so a lower price could be seen again. We\\'ve had three of these Kindles. They are well built and you can\\'t get the quality in a tablet from any other manufacturer. Amazon has great support with them. This was a great purchase! Love the fact I can download TV or movies and watch off-line. Easy set up. I bought this for my wife she loves how easy it is to use and small enough to take on trips. I bought the first edition kindle fire years ago. My kids loved it so much that I bought this product to replace the old one. They love this one even more. Larger screen and more memory, you can\\'t go wrong! Gift for my grandpa so he can do internet searches from his chair and play games. He loved it. It\\'s simple to use and inexpensive I love my kindle fire it\\'s is good for watching movies reading and anything you need a tablet for. We get this after my son broke his Samsung tablet and I told was android operating system but wen the time to set it up came, takes me a little lounger to make a new account, password and paretal control for my kid but am happy that finally did it This was a replacement for an Amazon Fire tablet. This was a an up grade for my daughter who broke the screen on her old one. She absolutely loved her old one. She says the new one is even better.!! I bought this kindle fire for my teenage son so he could use it at school and play games on the kindle, he loves it. You will not find another tablet like this with the affordable price. This tablet is small enough to pack but the screen is the perfect size for watching movies on the plane when traveling. love the ease of use with tablet, have not had any issues I highly recommend kindles. I wouldn\\'t own anything else. I love reading and this is the best device yet not only for reading. This has wifi capabilities. I would highly recommend this item. I had Microsoft Surface, unfortunately daughter dropped and cracked screen so needed a new tablet. Since went back to laptop for work didn\\'t need another Surface. Settled on 8\" Kindle HD over Samsung and IPad mini due to value. I only use for social networks, email, games, internet search, and occasional viewing of videos. This is a good basic tablet that can handle this no problem with a good wifi connection. Great value as I paid under $100 during the holidays and it has been as good as my Surface for these basic uses. I recently upgraded to this model of Kindle. Liked it so much I bought this one for my daughter. She loves it. It\\'s much nicer than the older model she and I had. I had a very early generation Kindle that I loved. I was unwilling to update my Kindle because it was so great. The new one I got from my wife made it look like the old one was standing still. It\\'s much faster and I love it. I love this tablet because of its user friendly interface. It reminds me of a starter tablet for kids, without being too much of a dull product. Great product. I got this as a gift for a family member and she loves it. Wry basic, but I guess, it\\'s ok for the price. Bought for a 6 year old. Bought as gift for senior. Setup process could be easier. Nice handheld size. Clear text. Easy to read books on. Bought this for my daughter to use in school, she loves it! Product works great! I also bought the older version for my mom and she lives it as well I would like to say this is my best tablet I have ever buy till now. I will rate it more then iPad Mini. Its best with battery, wifi, touchscreen, sound etc. I had other tablet for my kids earlier, but after having fire hd8, I will not recommend or like to go for any other brand in future. You can\\'t get such good quality product in such less price. I am really very happy on my right decision to choose fire hd8 for my family and kids. This is a good product for your money. It\\'s basic it does the job. Love the access to films. Easy to read and work with. A Little like an Android. I am used to IPhone apps but this works great once you understand it. Broke the screen on our 2nd gen fire so this is it\\'s replacement. Easy setup, Much faster than older one. Just the right size for games, email, social media. This is decent reader and Netflix device. Lots of bugs and gotchas when trying to use - icons going off screen, random locking, random performance hits while doing the same task. Returned. Buying an iPad mini 2. The build quality is just not there. Great and informative service. The guy who helped us was very friendly. Love the Fire, the picture is good and really like the amazon link I have an LG tablet but picked up this one for my Dad and after messing with it for a while it\\'s very nice,. I think I like it more the my LG g pad! This is a great tablet. My family and I love it. Lots of feature and faster than I thought it would be. Better then the older models bigger and better then before I really enjoy my amazon. It is getting easyer to use and I am finding new apps every day. This tablet is awesome...HD resolution, fast processor and affordable! Highly Recommended. Nice tablet. Very speedy. The only thing I don\\'t like is that I can\\'t add GooglePlay apps to it. At only $69.00 I guess that\\'s to be expected. I use my kindle on a daily basis. It is a good size for reading in bed. The kindle was great but too small for my vision impaired mother, it was a gift, My son totally loves it! The size is just right, and it is pretty fast. I don\\'t have any complaints about it. On Christmas Eve I went in looking for an iPad as a gift. They were sold out and I was directed to the Amazon Fire HD8. The picture quality is amazing (hence the HD). I watched a movie on it and the picture was better than my HD tv. I have to say, I would buy this tablet over an iPad any day...AND it cost less than a fourth of the price! Decent tablet for the price. My kids love them!!!! I am extremely pleased. Fast. Efficient. Reliable. Purchased to watch movies. Quality is great. Sound from tablet needs work but earphone is usually used or at least recommended for personal use. My son loves his kindle fire. He uses it every day. The Amazon Fire HD8 tablet is a high quality, inexpensive piece of technology that works great for anyone looking to purchase one that won\\'t break the bank. Once taking time to install google play store, It functioned as good as any other android tablet. The down side is camera which doesn\\'t produce clear pictures. Bought for someone not tech savvy and he\\'s done great Bought this tablet on sale. I can look up all the things I \\'m interested in. This is a great product second one i purchase recomend it. The tablet has a very clear and crisp screen. The device is easy to setup. There is a quite abit of preinstalled apps. The responsiveness is great, connectivity is good, but sound is not great. This tablet is great considering how affordable it is! I mainly use it for reading, streaming shows, and listening to music. I do wish it was a true Android platform instead of the \"Amazon Android\" platform, but overall it\\'s a great little tablet! It\\'s great for my 7 year old. Easy for her to use. Wasn\\'t happy with first one I opened as Christmas gift, it didn\\'t work from right out of the box. Contacted Amazon and they sent a new one the next day. This one has worked from the get go. I\\'m now enjoying my new tablet. Very happy with Amazons service and prompt response to the issue. This is good for kids. Cheap enough that if they destroy it, you won\\'t get upset Great product for my 10 year old son. Very easy for him to find what he wants Love Alexa and all of its features. Love that I can listen to music and read ebooks Paid $60 for it on sale during holidays, couldn\\'t ask for better product for the price Bought this for each of my grandchildren and they loved it. Very user friendly Great value from Best Buy. Bought at Christmas sale. great tablet well worth the price which was a deal on black friday Original Kindle Fire would finally no longer charge so bought this to replace. Not quite the quality of original (not as fast, resolution not as good) but can\\'t complain for the price. Good choice for casual web surfing and reading. Does the trick. This is a good tablet for the price. I bought this for my 3yr old son and it\\'s perfect for him! With a mixture of games (kid friendly) and read-along books makes it a perfect for the kids and of course there\\'s so much more for adults as well.. great buy! Great tablet, especially for the price. I bought this to replace an old Fire 7 tablet, that I had the battery going down. It works nicely and I love the Kindle Freetime and the parental control settings. Great little tablet for cruzing the internet and using Amazon products. I purchased it hoping I could use it as an inexpensive screen for my DJI Phantom 4. It works OK in this fashion, but I believe it is underpowered for the job. I bought this for my niece and she really enjoyed it. She was able to watch Netflix on it and play games. She could surf the internet if she needed to. We went with the bigger GB since it wasn\\'t much more. Gave it as a door prize at office party. They love it. This tablet is simple to set up and it\\'s worth the price. It\\'s perfect for beginners. Great tablet for easy operation. Was a great upgrade for a family member. My 2nd Fire. Great picture quality. Easy to use. Would recommend for all ages. I bought this to take on cruise to read and listen to music... less expensive than my tablet, so if I loose it not as big a loss... it does all I thought it would..easy to set up... to get the most from this tablet you should be an amazon prime member $100 a year, not required,but lots of benefits from it OK its not an iPad, but it is a very good tablet for less than 100 dollars.My only complaint is that it don\\'t have a true GPS chip and relies on your WiFi reported location for apps and therefore some apps cannot be loaded on this device that rely on a true GPS. But it is a great travel tablet and with an SD card you can download your Amazon or other content and watch offline. A great travel tablet! For the price you get alot of valueGreat for watching movies amazon shopping youtube I got a magenta color because I loved the beautiful purple-ish color shown on the picture. Instead I got a really bright pink-ish color which looks nothing like the color shown here. I went to the store hoping to replace it with a different color but was told that since I bought it on sale, I had to pay the $30 dollar price difference if I wanted to exchange. Unbelievable. The product is good but I never liked the Best buy customer service. This product met all of our my needs and I would recommend it to others. Would recommend for the right person that wants low cost tablet BUT...Ended up returning this item because it was heavy and too wide for my hand to hold. It was too big to hold in hand and too small to use like a larger tablet. Ended up just using my Lenovo Yoga 900 since it was more flexible and only about .5 lb heavier. I have the HD 7 and an HDX 7, and the 8 outperforms them both. If you are an Amazon fan of the eco system, this is a must. The screen is bright and crisp. The processor performs very well with the latest software update. I love it. Bought to use for recent travel. Was able to download several movies and TV shows from Netflix. Seems to have decent storage. Video playback was fine. Just purchased the Amazon Fire 16GB model and so far it has performed as expected. Only drawback is the screen which is somewhat reflective of any light source and needs constant cleaning for smudges from normal use. Easy to set up and use. Nice graphics and lots of apps to choose. I got this for my husband who is technology challenged and so far, he\\'s using it without getting frustrated, which is huge! love the first now a new one. everything at your fingertips. purchased for a little guy, and i am very pleased with it!! Perfect gift for the office co-workers or close friends This is actually a pretty good little tablet. It is not the most powerful and it doesn\\'t have the highest resolution screen. But for the price, you can\\'t go wrong. It does what it is supposed to do and for the low price you won\\'t feel much pain if you break it. A perfect first tablet for the kids or a nice secondary tablet that you can just toss in a bag or the car for road trips. Amazon Fire tablets are the best products in their price ranges, especially if they are on sale as they were at the last Black Friday event. Excellent purchase. I bought this as a way to easily read while on the go. I\\'m disappointed as it\\'s really too big too easily carry around. I\\'ve discovered it\\'s not all that easy to use it for reading purposes This tablet is the best one we\\'ve ever bought. And, the least expensive! It satisfies all of our needs; email, Facebook, Candy Crush, YouTube, Bluetooth broadcasting to a remote speaker. We love it. No frustration whey using the keyboard or finger clicking on icons or commands! i was surprised buy how light and compact this was but still strong enough to do what i needed. Great for reading. Ordering books and use as a tablet. For the price, this tablet is not bad. I found a couple of things that is a bit annoying. Every time you turn on the device, ads will appear in the lock screen. Also the picture gallery, it takes several minutes to load. The wait is very annoying. For the price, you can\\'t beat this tablet. It is fast and basic. I had problems with my White page and was in the process of buying ad new Kindle I found this was a better unit for my use than tine White-page. Perfect for the price. It is great to bring with you on the go. And like I said can\\'t beat the price. The only con is it has a plastic back so be careful. The battery is great. I would absolutely recommend this product. This tablet is not a high-tech state-of-the-art Speed Demon, but on the other hand it is more than good enough for daily use. The two biggest benefits to me are that it now comes with Alexa built in, and, you can download Amazon movies to the device to watch offline, for example on an airplane. These two features alone make it worth the very reasonable price. good value for the money .............................................................................................................. Gave this to my wife for Christmas. Upgraded from the original Kindle. She thoroughly enjoys it. Fire is a good tablet. Portable size . Have bought a couple for gifts as well This tablet is really easy to use and since I\\'m a Amazon Prime member the video\\'s and music is easy to access. I\\'m really surprised how fast the unit compared to my older i-pad. I would recommend this if anyone wants a good value product. This is a great tablet for the money. Perfect for someone who does not want to shell out hundreds for an iPad. like a tablet. great, fast connection. everything I wanted in an electronic reader. No problems with the fire. Works well. Just need a case for it now. Size is very convenient. I bought this for my mom and she loves it. She said it is really easy to use and loves the lighting, it\\'s easy for her to read. Very helpful and friendly. Didn\\'t have too much selection on what I was looking for. But found what I needed. This tablet is so great for the price, but Amazon has always put out excellent product. This is fairly lightweight and pretty fast too. Like all Amazon product it ties all your Amazon accounts so downloads and purchases are super easy. I have dropped it a couple of times and no damage... so it\\'s pretty tough too. It is a great and affordable tablet for my 12 & 13 year old grandsons. It keeps up with the higher speed internet. So far the tablet works great. I got this for my daughter for Christmas and she downloads games no problem. The 16gb is great I\\'m glad I purchased the larger storage capacity. very good for kids to use, play games and watch kids videos. I like that it gets 12 hours of charge time. Easy to use. i bought this on a whim because my brother recommended i try it sometimes. hard to believe how important this is in my life. this has opened up my long forgotten youth with music and videos anytime Was looking for a cheap tablet for my a son to use saw this unit on sale on black Friday good unit. Basic internet plus a ton of Amazon apps and some standard ones too. If you want to use Amazon it is an excellent tool. Easy setup. Confusing screens but practical and inexpensive. Really enjoy this product. Love watching movies and playing games on my Fire HD 8 Great rablet, clear screen and small design. Great for watching movies. Great for keeping around the house and doing basic Internet functions. For traveling it lets you bring books, movies and/or tv shows via Amazon so being Amazon Prime is a plus.For you business travelers, out of the box it can open, view, & edit MS Office files, .docx, .xlsx, & .pptx.All this for 25% the price of a iPad. Yes, the iPad can do more, but do you need it? I pulled the trigger on the fire tablet knowing the I would have to install the google play store separately. with some work this could be the most bang for your buck for an android tablet. Purchased for my niece for a Christmas gift. She loves it no complaints Best tablet money can buy for under 100$. Very happy with its performance and responsiveness. External speaker is much better on this than my more expensive samsung tab E tablet. I use it at home instead of a computer. I gave it four stars instead of five because it seems to lose wifi frequently. However this could be due to house wifi issues. The tablet is fast and easy to use. Love the ease of downloading books. Got this tablet on sale for $59.99 at Best Buy and got Webroot Internet Security free with purchase. This is not a high end tablet but it works really great for many of the things I do. For the price it can\\'t be beat! Easy to use and portable. Took on vacation and it was great to kkep up on emails and news. Really handy. Can check email, read a book. Also can access info on the web. Lightweight. I was hesitant to buy a Fire tablet but I just needed an extra around the house tablet and I was very impressed. If you need a tablet just to browse the internet, watch movies and light basic searches its perfect. Purchased the device for my son to take full benefits of his prime account. A decent device with reasonable features for the low cost. Bought this for my 5 year old son. He navigates through apps and sites easily. The built in Wifi is helpful for car rides. Parental controls blocks him from buying every download he finds attractive. We\\'re still trying to figure out how to get Alexa to audio respond. This product is very easy to set up and use. Has lots of great features that make it fun and easy for kids to play games and read books. Bought this as a Christmas gift for my wife. She is an avid reader. She previously had a B&N Nook which stopped working. This is much nicer and she loves it. Would recommend for someone who likes to read while traveling or simply at home. Bought this tablet for a child at Christmas. After days of research, this tablet seemed to be the best buy of the lot. It had a good processor, decent memory, and good reviews. It should be exactly what a 12 year old would need in a tablet at a great price. I was looking for and cost effective solution to satisfy my childrens desires to have there own SmartPhone to play Games.I like the Parental controls, to limit certain actions and downloads. Great easy tablet for a reasonable price. Not the most super powerful. It can get the job done for simple tasks such as surfing the web, checking email, playing YouTube, etc. screen is clear and responsive. Great inexpensive tablet It was a gift for my granddaughter and she seems very happy with it so far. Purchase for a 12 year old. Sturdy, easy to usr. Great price I gave this as a gift for Christmas and still can\\'t get it set up will have to go to geek squad to help This tablet is great and easy to use. Great way to keep the kids entertain. It replaces my 6\" Fire Kindle. Love the HD quality. Owned a kindle fire HDX for GameCircle years. Finally decided Goodreads upgrade. This fire HD 8 is great. Really Prime the larger screen and new features. Amazon tablet that links to my amazon prime account so that i can watch all my movies and listen to my music. Grandson used a borrowed one at school. So now has his own . Great tablet for children and for entertainment... This is a great tablet for the price it is offered at. Great for amazon prime members. my third amazon fire, has more features than my old one. battery lastlonger Pretty good tablet especially for the price. That being said, it could be slightly faster when opening apps and running certain processes. Overall good machine for the price. Nice size. Good processor speed. Not happy that I cannot gety Google music. I think that my Amazon tablet does all that I need for it to do.Handy to have when traveling.Easy to operate. While this tablet doesn\\'t have the screen resolution that I\\'m used to it\\'s a nice beginner tablet. Faster than my old Fire HD tablet I purchased years ago... Great value. Daughter loves it. Easy to use and navigate for her. I bought the 8\" version on impulse because of an excellent offer on Black Friday. As an Amazon product, it offers Amazon apps. While you can get Google Play apps, it requires some hoops. I just discovered I can\\'t save movies from Netflix because that only applies to the HDX version. So this product has limits. But used as a Kindle reader, or to get email via wifi, or other uses (wifi only) while traveling where you wouldn\\'t want to take an expensive device, it is a good choice. This is such a wonderful value for the money!!Clear display with great color!! Tablet is wonderful for young kids. There\\'s ways to switch it to kid friendly This was a Christmas present so it hasn\\'t had a lot of use yet but so far this tablet has worked well and was straightforward to set up We bought one of these for our 2 year old a few months ago and we liked it so much we bought one as a Christmas present for a 65 year old parent. It obviously isn\\'t the highest quality tablet on the market, but it very responsive and gets the job done. And, you can\\'t beat the price; just a great value.

Turns out the Fire is much better than I expected. Well worth the $50 I paid for it! Gave this as a gift and she was very pleased. Great product at a great price! I am bring it back for an exchange. (a different make) Beautiful picture. Enjoying different apps and looking forward to hours of fun. Works well. Easy to use. I like the auto on when you open the case I bought this for my son for Christmas. He loves it. He can use it to access the web. This item is great for kids, it is education. You canaccess over 13,000 books on amazon. It has helped my son with his reading.

Also like feature of \"Alexia\". got this for wife for christmas she loves thing she can read her kindle book and surf the web like a regular tablet Great e-reader. Easy to download books. Screen is easy to read from. purchased for my mom and showed her a few apps and she took to it without further direction Nice tablet for the price. Being amazon prime member, I am using many amazon services and devices, tablet is really handy for managing it all very easily apart from other basic functinality of tablets. Had a Fire 7 previously which was ok but this one is brighter, faster and the larger keyboard makes a huge difference. Bought this tablet for my mom who struggles with technology. The Fire HD8 was easy to setup and has many great features. She is catching on well and learning new applications daily. A great value. I\\'ve never had a tablet, I-phone, Smartphone . . . Nothing but PCs. This is my first foray into these modern electronics. I must say that, while I still find it very nerve-wracking, this Amazon Fire Tablet has been pretty user-friendly for an old man like me. I\\'m learning something new about it every day. Got it for my grandma. She loves it , has no complaints about it. For the price you can\\'t beat this tablet for kids. I\\'m not a fan of Amazon\\'s super restricted App Store, but the device itself is very good. I love the curfew feature. You can set up times that a child can or can\\'t access the tablet without your permission. This is so much easier to travel with than the lap top. Gave to my Grandchildren for Christmas, would like to get another for the same price for another Grandchild. I took a couple of pictures with the camera and when I went to view them I can\\'t seem to find the pictures. When I bought my tablet they transferred what I had on my 7in but some of the apps didn\\'t transfer. I\\'ll have to come in and have it explained.Other than that I am very pleased with it. Bought this for my gf since she is on her phone playing games etc. I\\'ve used it a few times and like it. Got this for my 11 yr old and my main concern was parental controls. Parental controls are an awesome feature and were easy to set up. Amazon had plenty of free apps for kids that i didnt need to purchase extra. Thank you I\\'m very happy with this purchase! We purchased these because we really liked the price. We also bought protective cases for both and an antivirus program for them. Bought this for my mom for Christmas. It is her first tablet. She loved it, and will have no problems learning to use it. Very straightforward and easy to pick up. Great storage, fantastic resolution and really good features. i really like this tablet..easy to use and looks great. Great tablet for the price, I would definitely recommend the higher gigabyte as it downloads quickly and doesn\\'t take time to upload. It has great picture quality, all the applications seem to load very fast. The device is a good item and I really recommend to everyone This Kindle was purchased on the black friday sale. At the time I felt it was a steal at that price. The first tablet I purchased a few years ago was the original Kindle Fire, the following year I purchased an iPad mini and now have the iPad mini 4. As you may already know, the iPad does not have explandable memory. This Kindle can have expanded memory to 200GB so that was a good selling point for me. After setting this new Kindle Fire up, I noticed that viewing photos were not as clear as the original iPad mini even without retina display, and the color had a greenish-yellowish tint to it. Some may not notice this if they do not have something else to compare it to. I\\'m a pro photographer so this was quite unaceptable to me. I was not expecting perfection with the colors but people\\'s skin tones appeared greenish as if they were Vulcans. I also like to read tech manuals and magazines of which many are in PDF format. The Kindle will read this format but the Kindle Fire after all these years still cannot display the cover art from pdf books, etc.; it displays an acrobat pdf document logo instead. If you have a large library of pdfs you have to read through the document titles instead of being able to select by seeing the cover of the book. That was enough for me, I\\'ve been spoiled by the ease of use of the iPad and the display with accurate colors. Back to the store for a prompt refund it went. Overall..still a good deal but if you are used to an iPad for the reasons I am..you may be disappointed. Works well. But does not offer access to the apple or android App Store. Without the apps that I need, this tablet is not as useful. this Amazon fire tab works really well.the syncing aspect is very nice being able to pair it with all my devices.i wish it had Google play. It\\'s a really good gadget ...I love everything about it... I would definitely recommend it to others since it is a good value for money product. Nice easy-to-use tablet. We just got it and so far so good Easy to use and please send me a $50 gift certificate for filling out this survey or cash works too. I bought this for my son. He been reading books and searching stuff on line and watching youtube on it. He said it didn\\'t hurt his eyes like the iPad. great product I would recommend this tablet, grest price This tablet is by far one of the best purchases we\\'ve made for my son. The kids feature is extra nice! While the Fire hd8 tablet certainly will not perform like some of the more expensive units, for basic web surfing, email, and especially shopping on Amazons web site, this tablet performs well, although it will occasionally freeze while surfing some sites. The screen resolution is what I would call \\'adequate\\', but not on par with other high resolution (and far more expensive) tablets out there.Overall, I am pleased with this tablet-so far. Purchased this Kindle Fire HD8 from Best Buy. My fiancé downloaded her first book. She already started reading and said it is really cool to use. She said it is easy to see and navigate. I have enjoyed using the Fire HD. It is fast and easy to use. I also appreciate all the things it will do. The kindle fire hd is a sweet tablet for reading and apps like netflix or hulu. It does everything my kids need without having to pay a ridiculous price. The kindle is great not only is it a reader its bascially a computer. It connects to the internet it takes pictures and has many other great features. very satisfied with tablet, very fast and efficient I really enjoy using this tablet it runs very well Tons of value, if you want a budget tablet look no further. We purchased this tablet for our son for Christmas, to replace a malfunctioning Kindle Fire 7. We like Kindle for our kids for the parental controls. So far, this Kindle has performed fine. He seems happy with it. Really crisp picture. Fast and good amout of storage. I got the kindle fire hd8 for my daughter for Christmas and she loves it very much The product is quite durable and user friendly in many aspects. This is our 4th kindle and we love them as \"beginner\" tablets for kids! No worries of data overages and with the sd card slot memory will no longer be an issue! My 10 year old has enjoyed playing on this. Great selection of apps and games. did not expect this kind of quality for the price I paid. very surprised. nice product. First off I can\\'t get over how much I like this one. The battery life is great the screen is nice and clear .... and bright. I would buy it again if anything ever happened to it. great compact tablet with great coclors and resolution-----decent battery life and good wi fi connectivity I love this tablet! It\\'s the perfect size. I can do everything on it and it was affordable! Can\\'t beat for price,feels expensive but isn\\'t. Does all the basics I love this tablet. The screen is so clear. So easy to read a book on. I\\'m loving my kindle fire. It does everything I need it to do and more. Works well but lacks forward control of screen and right and left movement on keyboard. Good foor short notes but could never do any substantial typing on this without external keyboard. Good for basic websurfing and email. The 8\" version is much better than the older 7\" version. Better graphics and faster processor Better then a E-book, more options and versatility I haven\\'t used a product like this and man I have to tell u it\\'s better than apple products This was exactly as advertised and did everything that was claimed. Setup was fast and easy and I have no complaints. Love this tablet for streaming, facebook, games and general web surfing. The apps are available on the amazon underground, not google playstore, so some apps that you may be used to using, may not be available on amazon underground. Overall, great tablet for the price. Would recommend. The screen is vibrant and clear. It is fast and doesn\\'t lag when going onto different sites. If you have Amazon Prime this is the tablet for you as it gives you access to unlimited, music, movies, and tv. Awesome purchase! Great size and storage for reading my online books Great price on a good tablet... especially on Black Friday The HD8 is a Great tablet. I purchased two for my daughter\\'s. The tablet feels durable to touch. The screen picture is crisp and clear. My grandson loved it. I had the smaller one but wanted to larger one for him. I received this as a gift. One of the best I\\'ve ever received. I bought two of these Fire Tablets for gifts for my sons. They are both thrilled with the features. They use them for gaming, music, photo albums, emails and online activities. The HD is what sold me. I have a Kindle Fire 2nd generation and I enjoyed mine so much since 2012, I looked into getting this one. I gave my husband this tablet for Christmas. He is very pleased with the product. He likes it much better than the last tablet that I purchased him 3 years ago. He highly recommends the product. Purchased due to reviews and in sale. So far easy to use. The Fire HD tablet is a good product. The screen has good viewing angles and the display is on point. However, the major issue I have are you have to be online to make any setting changes to the tablet.; and the advertisements that show up on the home screen is a downer. So, the rating of a 4 star is pushing for me. It\\'s such a great tablet !!! Love the picture and everything about it is amazing. I\\'m glad I chose this one and what a great deal I got on Black Friday Bought for a 6 years old she loves it and is always on it great starter tablet My 6 year old got it for Christmas and is able to use it very well Gift for daughter. She loves it. Just opened so as far as I know it will be a great purchase. Great product as usually ... better screen and faster than my previous. Work with my chromecast .. easy to use This my second kindle .. it\\'s light and faster than my previous kindle ..came with free audio books for 30 days which is cool ... better screen .. it does seem to be long than wider .. which I\\'m ok with and I got this on sale for 60 .. great deal I used to watch youtube on my phone and wife decided I needed something bigger. I seem to like it very much. I did buy a micro sd card for it. I previously had a nook that died and tried the Fire and I was hooked. Great price and lots of things to do PICKED THIS TABLET UP ON BLACK FRIDAY. WHAT A GREAT DEAL. WORKS AWESOME AND HAS ALL OF THE AMAZON APPS. Second one, bigger, better, easy as pie to set up. I bought this orange Fire Hd8 on Black Friday so it was at a great price. My husband likes it a lot. It was purchased as a replacement for his previous Fire 7 tablet that was having charging issues. I\\'ve heard of a several others having the similar issues so hopefully this model lasts longer and has an improved charging port. Bought it for my dad who loves tech that his life easier the alexa integration is fantastic. Purchased this as a gift for my father and he\\'s loving it. bought two for the family and they connect easily and work surprisingly fast for a small price. I use my fire hd8 to download books from the library. Easier to read than on my smartphone. We bought this to replace my children\\'s aging Ipads and they\\'re very happy. I was looking for a easy to use tablet for a beginner and this met my needs . Bought this during black Friday sale offer, was a good purchase and cheap. The Kindle Fire HD is an impressive Product. It is faster than my Samsung tablet. I know I will enjoy using it. I just wish that Amazon Prime music had a downloadable app for it. It is great , I like it very much. I can find anything you want. Enjoy the pad and its options. Its a great starter pad for kids. Downloading is a breeze, works quick and effective for what I bought it for. Very pleased. if you had a kindle fire 1st. this one is mush better.with all the new stuff inside . I bought two of these for the grandkids, I was going to show them how to set them up, didn\\'t need to! ilovemy kindle 8\" . However it has crash a couple of times and am not sure why. also the 8\" case is not made for this kindle because the clamps used to hold it are right on the buttons to turn on and volume. so if you have a better case for it please let me know. Works very well. Cheaper than an iPad and works great for apps and video. This was so easy to set up and the print can easily be adjusted to extra large. My 78 year old dad was really happy with his first experience with technology. He is now surfing the net and reading news online. Highly recommended. horrible...just like the other 7 i have owned ONLY due to warranties I got 2 of these for my 8 and 9 year old daughters and I love them and so do they LOVE BEING ABLE TO MAKE SPECIFIC PROFILES FOR MY CHILDREN We love the kindle fire HD8. it can have various profiles to accomodate all people who uses it in our family household. it is also very easy to set up Bought this Kindle because of the great price. Good thing, because I dropped the other one without the case on it and it cracked. I purchased this as alight weight replacement for my laptop. It has accomplished everything I needed. I\\'m sure there will be something\\'s I still need HP for, but this is a great tablet for what I needed. I got a case and 64gig card also. Everything works seamlessly so far. I upgraded my mother\\'s 3rd generation Amazon Kindle Fire HD 7\" to this new one and she likes the display being bigger to 8\" and is much faster. My husband bought this on Black Friday at a really great price! He loves how lightweight this is, and offers him his email, internet functionality and books, of course. Great buy! This fire is much better than the old one so far. It responds much faster and has a much better screen. I also put a 128 gig memory stick into it which the old fire could not accommodate. So far, so good. This was purchased an a reward for a job well done. Set up was easy and the functionality was perfect for my needs. I found this to be a great tablet for all ages-easy to use-great content. You cannot get a better tablet for the price and Best Buy had it on sale. Daughter loves it. Everything transferred from her Kindle to the fire. She said it is unbelievable fast. This version is a really good upgrade over the older fire tablet that we had before. Very happy with it. It is awesome play pokemon and clash use silk its awesome great present I bought as a Christmas gift for my 9 year old and she loves it. It works great and my package arrived early with no issues. I purchased this item for my son as a Christmas gift. His eyes lit up as he unwrapped it on Christmas morning. Later in the day, his older cousin had to call me and verify if he had truely received this item as a Christmas gift... I also plan on taking Best Buy up on their e - mailed offer that I received, which states that I can receive free start up service to get me started with my tech purchase. One of the best tablets on the market for its value Bought this for my six year old son for a Christmas present and he loves it. He couldn\\'t be happier it keeps him very entertained. This tablet was such a good deal definitely no complaints here. Best buy has the greatest deals love this store. Strong fast tablet. My 8 year old can manage it perfectly! Does what I wanted it to do. Really like the way it performs. Does not let me connect with my library. Very diapointed I purchased this for my wife so that she has an option other than her phone or laptop to browse the internet. I Love this tablet its Awesome and way Cool I highly recommend this to anyone Great price great value for the pricing...black friday special Inexpensive, No need to worry about it getting broken/lost It is very handy great when i don\\'t want to use a computer and i can take it anywhere Bought it for my wife and the fire does not have to be recharged as often as the paper white. she likes it bought this during black friday (actually Thursday). ok for price. but not cool i had to buy extra storage for not a great price. I started with the 7\" little brother and liked it a lot, so I decided to upgrade to the larger model. I use it primarily as an e-reader and for some net surfing and Facebook. The WiFi works great and is ready to access and use. Don\\'t buy this unit if you want cell (4g) access to the Internet. It is WiFi only. Frankly, my cell phone takes better pictures, but that\\'s not what I really wanted from the unit. All in all, a great reader with excellent battery life. A great alternative to the more expensive iPad. I prefer my paper white for reading but this is great for everything else. Great gift idea. Nice addition to the kindle family. So far it does what I want. Very happy with the price too. I read the reviews, before I purchased this item and.... So far, so GOOD! The handy-dandy case that I found on sale for 9.99, at the same time works well too. I\\'ve owned a Kindle Fire HD7 before and this newer Kindle fire didn\\'t disappoint. It does the job really well for most things and the price you pay, but don\\'t expect it to be a top of the line tablet. Everything I needed it for. Screen is nice enough and price was right. The 8-inch screen makes it very easy to use and read the print of books. Overall quality is very good. Perfect for my wife and college daughter. Very easyTo learn reader. My Dad, retired Vietnam veteran, received this as a gift and he Loves it so much. Very user friendly and great quality for the price. Picture is great. Quick response when going from site to site. Sound is not so good but what I expected from a tablet. very easy to set up and use. seems to be good quality Purchased on Black FridayPros - Great Price (even off sale)Very powerful and fast with quad core processors Amazing soundWell builtCons -Amazon ads, Amazon need this to subsidize the tablet and will remove the adds if you pay them $15.Inability to access other apps except the ones from Amazon. There is a way which I was able to accomplish to add the Google Play storeNet this is a great tablet for the money I purchased this as a gift and I\\'m had I did. This tablet far exceeds my expectations. Very pleased with my tablet. Love that it\\'s HD and user friendly. I thought twice about getting this because of people saying you have limited apps but its not to limited so I am very happy. I was able to get google youtube Netflix and all the main apps I actually care about. For the price you cannot do any better. Love it so much we ended up getting my kids each one. good for reading for a long hours since battery last over 6 hours. I will recommend it to my relatives and friendas Key to owning this tablet is having amazon prime account Easy to use and navigate. Great for watching movies and videos!! Bought two of these for my kids for Christmas. Love the level of control it gives me to supervise and monitor usage. Best deal I have seen online. I checked Amazon and they were not as good. We bought this as a gift for someone who travels often. She loves it and said the quality it as expected. Great battery life and picture quality. The camera is not the greatest but I often don\\'t use it for the camera. I usually have my phone with me so I use that instead. Can hold a lot of books too. The Amazon Fire HD8 is a great tablet at a bargain price. Purchased at Christmas time for $59. It\\'s an even better value if you have an Amazon Prime account. Only downside is the use of Amazon\\'s Appstore instead of the Google play store which has more variety. I bought 3 three of these for my boys for Christmas gifts. Great little tablet. Perfect for everything they want to use it for. Greatest small tablet. Just wanted something convenient. My wife loves her Fire Hd8 she had one of the older models so i up graded her to this new model and she feel in love with it right away The amazon kindle fire is a great reader on a budget. It has most of the basic functions of standard tablets(Ipad, galaxy tablets) at a fraction of the cost. It also has access to a huge amazon library of books. We got 2 of these tablets in black Friday for a great price! its a pro if you have amazon prime, since everything around this tablet is amazon base- shopping, videos, books, and alexa. Bought this tablet for my kiddos. Pretty good, easy to use Always a good price and good for what it\\'s meant for. Amazon Fire is great for reading my Kindle Books, checking email, facebook, or checking out the internet. Haven\\'t ck\\'d out what else I can do with it, but I\\'m sure there is a lot. Love the Amazon Fire HD tablet, easy to get around Download games, movies, education apps to help ur kids to learn to read do math problems and keep them entertained while on the road or family trips These are excellent to keep on the coffee table or taking along on a trip. Can\\'t beat the price. Definitely worth the investment...I may get a couple of more! My daughter had a smaller eight GB tablet ... this was a nice step up for her and with better graphics. We extended the memory with an SD card for photos. Bought for my son and he enjoys playing in it. He\\'s able to download all the apps he wanted and the camera is awesome. Love this Kindle. It is my fourth kindle and it is best one yet. This tablet works great and my daughter loves it. Only reason not 5 stars is because you cant access google play without rooting the tablet. Way to ruin android amazon. i use the hd8 for my personal entertainment system I have had many tablets, Samsung, Asus and old Ipad. This Fire holds its own . The Silk system is not quite as speedy but the lack of bloatware is nice. There is a hack to get more google apps. It\\'s light to hold, the ads are not invasive. I enjoy taking advantage of the Prime benefits. Simple to operate. Would recommend for everyday use and movie/reading music consumption. Christmas gift so it\\'s to early to tell, arrived on time Christmas gifts for 2 granddaughters. They loved there first ones. time for a update There are better tablets, but at this price point the Fire HD 8 is outstanding. Reasonably priced and great for the grandkids. We purchased cheaper tablets for them last year and none of them lasted! So far these are looking 100% better. This baby is a bargain. Very good screen, decent overall quality and performance...and now Alexa. I use it with Bluetooth speaker and it has become my office music machine. Hold the home button and ask Alexa to play easy jazz. No muss; no fuss. Improves upon \\'regular\\' Alexa because she has a screen now!. I got exactly what I was expecting with this purchase, a low cost device for media consumption (e-books, movies, music) with surprisingly decent performance in the few games I\\'ve tried on the device. The MicroSD expansion card slot is a must-have for me when purchasing any tablet device. This was a gift for grandchildren. I am sure they will love, seeing they used the older one we have. Most people will go with a bigger more sofisticated iPad or Samsung but this is a good product for a child to pass time or someone not wanting all the bells and whistles Perfect cheap device for kids and grandkids nice to have sitting around This Fire HD 8 is my first such device. I find it to be easy to operate and very responsive.The touch screen control takes getting used to as I often click on the wrong close part of the screen and have to go back. The Alexa voice assistant surprised me when she announcedherself over the speaker. (I shut her off since I\\'m not a fan of conversing with computers).My main complaint is that comes with nothing but a charger and cable. The wordless, pictorialstart up instructions were primitive and vague. There are no instructions on how to use thisdevice; no sample book to test and get familiar with. There is a help function thatfills in some basics of functionality but not thorough enough. The WiFi connectivity is great, using the latest protocol and encryption. It has a simple web browser but web time also seems to be the greatest drain on the battery. The cable can be used toattach to a Windows PC and transfer files (books, music, pictures etc). I would also recommend buying a protective case for if its ever accidently dropped. This Fire tablet is a nice upgrade to the one I purchased 3 years ago. The screen is great, it is very fast, has lots of storage with the SD card, and just an all-around good product. And a great value. This tablet is an easy device to download sites and convenient too! Purchased the 8 inch Fire tablet during Black Friday and have been using it since. A great deal. Doesn\\'t disappoint. Nice features. Owned two prior to this one. Very nice tablet. This is my first tablet and I\\'m excited about learning how to use it. I have not used it a ton yet but I am very happy with my experience so far. This is great for an 8 yr old. She had out grown her Nabi and likes taking pictures this does just the trick. The memory can be extended to hold more pictures. Great tablet. I started out with an original kindle and wanted one with backlight and the price was too good to pass up! I LOVE my fire! I subscribe to both Amazon Prime and Netflix, and it\\'s perfect for those. Plus you can add additional memory cards. I have bought iPads for everyone in my house, and bought this for myself and am in heaven. The camera isn\\'t good though, but I don\\'t use it. For the money, this is an incredible value. Black Friday deal. Great alternative for my 2 IPads. Great stuff to have. It is a good tool to help your kids go out and find knowledge! And this does help. Wanting knowledge should still be encourage. First time user and very pleased. Great for me because of my book downloads. Not too big and not too small. This Kindle fire is amazing. I love how kindlely and fiery it is. Great value for such a well made tablet. Everything you need for a low price I purchased this tablet and am very happy with it. We bought this Fire HD to replace an older model and the kids love it. Ease of use and the integration with Amazon Prime makes the product worth every moment. It is mostly used to watch movies and play some games so it works well for what is needed. Great for the price but if you need more options as far as productivity goes you may want to stick with an iPad or Galaxy Tab. This product my not fully compare to more expensive tablets, but Amazon has made improvements that provide a platform to watch media and read. Further, Amazon has made significant strides to provide a music platform which also improves the value of this tablet. Loved the Fire HD7 but the latest HD8 is sharper, faster and still handles great. Easy to use tablet. Good price. Great for beginners as well as intermediate users. Fun! Great product simple easy to understand great value!!!! I bought this tablet as a replacement for my wife\\'s Fire TV HDX 8.9 as her battery life is starting to decrease as it is getting older. Unfortunately, she was not happy with it as the tablet is slightly smaller screen wise (the next step is 10\" which is way too big, and has 4 less hours of battery life) and I was disappointed despite it being a newer tablet it was not able to decode HEVC, like the Fire TV 2015 boxes we have connected to our televisions. This unfortunately is a show stopper, as we can\\'t view the movie library we have on this tablet. We will wait until a newer version comes out that is improved. Great price and good quality screen image in a nice 8\" format. I installed a 128 GB microSD card with no problems. I was impressed with the quality of the device and it fit a generic tablet cover that was too big for the 7\" generic tablet I had previously purchased. I wished I had gotten a few more during the black Friday sale. It came with a charger and cable. Great tablet/e-reader. You can do a lot on this bad boy!! Great all around Tablet. Does a little bit of everything along with being the best e-reader around. Great quality and decent price. Love features and the fact that I can mirror my tablet on my tv with firestick. Perfect for teenage tablet, perfect for homework!! This tablet is well worth the money. It has descent performance and good screen resolution. And it is definitely a great tablet for beginners. This is the one for those who don\\'t want to spend more on tablets. Really great product. It\\'s pretty good! Did what I needed? I love this tablet. It does pretty much every thing my ipad does!!!! Hoped this Fire HD 8 would be faster than my old HD Fire...not so much, I guess I expected the new Fire HD 8 to perform better but it still lags and is slow to load information while surfing the Internet. My wife\\'s Ipad is light years ahead on this one, but what do you expect from a 60-70 dollar tablet. It works well for what I needed. I purchased for great price on black Friday. My mom had been wanting one for a while, so this was great. The 8 In Fire tablet does everything my nexus 7 tablet did; but also has the added benefit of expandable storage. Great budget tablet. Just needs good sized microsd card! Nice tablet for media consumption for the price. For Amazon user for sure I\" like it a lot, easy to use , A big improvement over the original, the price was increideble (black friday special)onclude a camera , front and rear, the quality is not as good as a cell phone, but is ok This tablet does everything it said it would. Works great. No complaints. I just wish it played .avi, but that is not really a huge problem I purchased this kindle on black friday for $60.it works very well as a reader and tablet. It has good battery life and silk is a decent option for a browser. I also side loaded the nook apponto this kindle. It works as well here as it does on my nookereader. The Amazon Fire HD8 16GB is a excellent value and performs accordingly for it\\'s price-point. It cannot be compared with a mini-ipad at a fraction of the price. The other drawback is the , limited apps as compared to the apple store or even google store. Yes, the google store can be loaded with a little difficulty. All in all for the money, it;s a nice little tablet. Has all of the functions of the expensive iPads and works great for fraction of the cost!!! After looking at several similar products, and looking at multiple reviews, the Amazon Fire HD 8 seemed like the best choice. The fact that it was on-sale one-third off on Black Friday made the final choice easy. We are very pleased with how this product works and how it met our needs for a bit larger screen. Easy for us mid-seventy year-olds to use. Upgraded my tablet to hd, previous owned the 7\" regular. I wanted a tablet so my grandkids can use instead of using my ipad. A great xmas gift. Very user friendly and straight forward instructions great for all ages I had a smaller version and this was easy to adjust to and use. Really affordable present for a kid.. Or just have around It\\'s a great tablet for the price. Fast and snappy This is a nice and cheap android device. HD display and Amazon\\'s sturdy build quality with 10 hours+ battery backup. Sometimes runs a little slow, rest is good Upgrade to my kindle fire 7, pleased with all the new features including Alexa I enjoy my Kindle immensely, so much better than having to start up my computer. Bought on Black Friday for my kids, my 3 year old can work it just fine with the kids app for watching YouTube and other videos. I picked this up as a doorbuster for my father-in-law. He has an Amazon account and can watch the movies he likes. My kids like it very much! The price is low. The tablet is light weighted. Love my Kendal but cannot find a case or screen saver for it. I am very satisfied with this tablet. I use it for browsing because the screen is larger than my phone. Caught it on sale and bought two. Good value for the money. It was recommended by a friend. Get a case for it, it is easier to hold on to. The second one will make a nice gift. This is an older tablet. I probobly expected too much. If I\\'m going to deal with lagginess I prefer my ipad2. Got this thing around Black Friday and only paid about 50 something bucks. Awesome equipment you can actually stream the web very glad I bought it can\\'t believe it so inexpensive! Great product...great price very easy to use...I got it for my nieces..they love it It is good. Some apps are not available. Easy to use. This was a gift for one of my granddaughters. She just loves this Kindle. This is the second one I\\'ve bought for her. This is a bigger and newer generation with lots more options. Fun to use and also easy for kids to use as well! Good tablet for books and games for all the family! Great tablet, perfect size, has night mode on display so you would be able to fall asleep if using at night - won\\'t keep you awake because blue light is filtered out. Response is great, colors IPS panel great, no blue tooth It\\'s a really great tablet. It even has Amazon Alexa built in, so I don\\'t have to buy Echo or Echo Dot. I originally bought it to use as a MP3 player but has so many features, I haven\\'t added any music to it. Very good for kids to learn and play games and research school work. Purchased these for my grandkids...and they absolutely love them. They can play play their games to their hearts\\' content. They ar ed really fast too. Great tablet for kids to use! Play games or read books and isn\\'t slow. I got this kindle because I broke my Fire 7\\'. It took some getting use to since the screen was bigger but overall it was a great purchase. Pretty happy with this so far. Like the fact that you can add memory. I love my new kindle fire HD8!!! It is a great tablet for all ages and easy to navigate!!!! I highly recommend this tablet for everyone!! Used for internet surfing . Does a great job, it\\'s great! Perfect price for the tablet and recommend for kids who don\\'t take care of electronics. Purchased a I-Pad and the kids broke it and was out $600.00. If they break the tablet I can purchase another on at the low cost at Best Buy. Picked this up during Black Friday and for the price is a great starter tablet for my kids Our tablet is fast and works very well. I am pleased with the amount of apps that Amazon offers. This tablet is really good for the price, especially on the holidays. If you are a movie watcher or just using it for games it has great speed with a quad core. Highly recommend so e-book as well. Very happy with my purchase I bought 3 already. My amazon fire is amazing, it is fast and is durable. Great table I pay cheap price is gift for my son my son is happy My daughter loves this tablet. Uses it for Netflix! So impressed with the battery life on this! My phone\\'s battery is almost dead in the morning, but this thing can play music for 8 hours and the battery just goes down 20%. :) I am glad that I made this choice for both my kids: they love this gadget it has things for them to learn and play. Great thing about this is customized content for children The Amazon tablet line is possibly one of the best our there. The functionalities of android and windows with the ease of use equal to an Ipad Tmtis is the second tablet I purchased for my kids. Its perfect for all the things my kids do. Amazon fire tablet is great and easy to use. Good value! Amazing tablet for the price. Lightning quick, screen quality is great and it has a great feel to it. It\\'s only limitation it\\'s the Amazon app store. I love how you can keep up with social media and watch movies online. This is fantastic!!! My wife loves reading on the tablet. It\\'s also great for surfing the web. I bought it for friend of mine, he really liked it. Works very well. Easy to carry around & connect to wifi. needed a tv in our kitchen, wasn\\'t looking for huge or fancy for this. so the 32 inch was perfect for us Works great. Easy conversion for an aging guy without much technological experience. I bought my Fire HD just for reading. I have a Kindle Unlimited membership and wanted to keep all my books in one place. This is an amazing little tablet. How Amazon can sell these for only $89 is beyond me. And I got mine on Black Friday, so it was only $59! At that price it was a downright steal. I had the first Kindle Fire. This model is better in every way imaginable. I also own an iPad Pro 9.7\". I don\\'t try to compare the Fire with the iPad, they are completely different devices. But for what the Fire is, I love it every bit as much as I love my Pro! I bought this as an upgrade from my old Kindle. Works awesome, i can even watch movies through my Amazon Prime. Plenty of apps to choose from. Awesome little tablet. Great beginner tablet for all ages. Easy to use by all ages. Bought this for our 8 year old for Christmas. Looks like he\\'s going to love it! Bought this for my niece for Christmas. I\\'m sure she will love it! Newest version of Kindle Fire product line is a hit. Larger screen for not much money, good screen resolution and longer battery life. No problems, and I\\'m a happy reader! Only cost me $59 at Black Friday. Good deal. Way cheaper than an iPad of which I have several. This was for my young kids. The only knock I have has to do with the you tube kids app for this vs apple products. On apple, you tube kids allows you to speak your search. You only have the option to type the search in for this which is problematic for young children who cannot read or write I am very happy with my product. It\\'s nice fancy HD is very cool. I am able to see and read my books in full format now. Thank you. This is a gift to my wife for xmas, don\\'t know yet if she likes it but I can\\'t see why she wouldn\\'t I was pretty impressed with this little device. It was easy to setup and works rather well. I had also bought a IPad Air 2 with 128GB during BF for $375. After playing around with the HD Fire I returned the Air 2 because it met my needs at a much lower price. I added a 64GB SD card and am downloading movies from Netflix. The HD display is very clear. Battery life could be a little better but overall I\\'m very satisfied with it. The free stuff you get with an Amazon Prime account is icing on the cake. I dig it! Easy to set up. Perfect size. Easy to read font. Price was affordable. Great gift idea for the adults on my Christmas list. Nice size tablet. Very easy to use. Love it!!!!! Beats my laptop. Love the tablet not to small, lightweight, and is easy to use. This tablet is the best you can buy for the money. Great apps, great picture. Very nice at a great price. Love Bose products. Highly recommend. This on is much better than the original Kindle Fire it is replacing. This is a Great budget table, it has has Great features for the price I was looking for at replacement tablet and this is exactly what I needed The tablet is great the jacket not so much - doesn\\'t stand up - hate it Does everything I need thank you. Alight small package easy to take anywhere Great kindle, perfect size screen, I love using it just as much as my iPad mini and regular size iPad! Easier to travel with! This is really nice and has great clarity I like it. outstanding replacement tablet for my outdated and overpriced iPad 2 I use it everyday after work for down time......... I brought it for my grandmother and she really loves it. This is so much better than the Kindle that I purchased 3 years ago. It is much faster, and I really like how long the battery last before needing to be charged. For what it does it\\'s great for me a good alternative I wanted something for games and reading so I thought this was a great deal. I have enjoyed it so much. Passes a lot of time for me. Easy to download on too. Bought it in order to watch NBC but the NBC app isn\\'t compatible, so now I have a paperweight. Got this for my kid. Great cheap tablet. Camera aren\\'t so good but usable. Apps load quick. Love the kindles. This was a gift and a great value. I have one myself. Great tablet for my son. Live the endless library of downloadable books. If you\\'re looking for a tablet to read books & surf the Internet, this is perfect. Great for beginner and intermediate. Highly satisfied!!! awesome, great value, good quality product, I would recommend this to anyone Gift for my mom and she absolutely loves it. It was exactly what she wanted. The Amazon Fire HD8 is a super fast tablet for the money. When combined with an Amazon Prime account the true value is released. We purchased tablets for nearly every family member and linked them all through one Amazon account. This becomes an unbelievable value. This was a perfect gift for the holidays! I saw the reviews on this and immediately had to get it! I bought this on Black Friday and I have been using it for about a month. It is faster than my Fire 7 2015 most likely due to the 1.5GB vs 1GB RAM. The screen resolution is fine though not the best. At this price I am not complaining. Amazon adds some nice features as well. The advertisements are discreet and only when the fire is turned on. Not a problem at all. Even at full price this is a good deal. I bought this tablet for my 7 years old and love it. Great parental control, set up goals for the day, turns off at the time, I decided. Works perfectly and very fast processor it\\'s all i needed while away from my computer on the go and at work. Perfect for streaming and an E-reader at a great price. Love this tablet. It does everything I need it to.My problem is, I have family that falls in love with it so I give mine away. If this wasn\\'t good, I wouldn\\'t be on my 3rd one.The only thing I would change is the silly ads and even worse browser. Other than that, a solid product! We got a great deal on Fire HD 8. My kids love playing on it. This is a pretty reliable tablet especially for the price. I use most of Amazon services (Prime, Kindle, Music, Video, Alexa) and this is the best companion to access all services seamlessly. This tablet also has great features/expansion and performance. I just like reading amd playing games on it..Better then those bulky computers I have an Amazon fire tablet and love it so hopefully he will also. Pretty easy to use as your first tablet. I\\'m loving my kindle. Early gift to myself. Happy! Needed an\\xa0inexpensive and portable Alexa device and this works perfectly. Allows for reading of my Kindle lib and even plays a few games This tablet is easy to use and great for a new user. its the best tablet that you can buy for the price and you can add a memory card to it. The new Fire HD8 tablet is a great purchase for the price; it\\'s fast enough for basic browsing, and you can download prime videos to watch on the go (which is why I bought it). We use them for classes, they work great and are easy to use for our older individuals Like that downloading books is fast. I am still learning features and have not explored other positives featured. If you\\'re a Amazon frequent flyer like me, HD fire is very fun and convenient placing all aspects of Amazon at your finger tips. The only thing i dont like about it is that its slow like most tablets. does everything our other tablets do and more. Like the sharing across platforms. Purchased this for my mother. She loves it, just the right size to grab and go. Great buy for the money. I read the online reviews and compared products. Same price here as on Amazon. I liked the idea of having both my Kindle and Tablet in one. This is a great product. Very inexpensive and a great gift for children. Replaced a Nook with the fire tablet. Disappointed that I cannot use Chromecast from it. Did not realize I would be tied to amazon. But it is a good tablet so far This item is a budget friendly gift for readers and internet browsers! The gift was great since I have a 10 I knew was a good present for a very deserved person! Good speed compared to the other models just the size and weighs very little. Large viewing area for a 8\" tablet HD Works great for anything from games to movies, nice big screen to enjoy anything you are doing with it. Best gift for Beginers. Less Price and enough speed and memory. Kids like it a lot. works great for the price.but it shoves amazon stuff down your hroat like the fire tv.and is linked to your amazon 1 click buy if you haveit set up that way. I was a ook user and have been converted to kindle. The size is great and it is very responsive. Got one for me and one as a gift. I expect my tablet to be a workhorse. Available to have two or three books open that I\\'m reading, hanging on to my email and ready with summaries of the news. The new Kindle Fire does it on a larger, brighter page. It is a work horse more than worth the money.. It goes with me might and day. I don\\'t know what I\\'d without this gem. My nephew is 3 years old and this is a great starter tablet. He is gonna be so excited Christmas morning. I replaced my old kindle as it took a power failure hit. The new kindle has been updated and it is easier to download the e-books. I am learning some of the new updates but it appears to be more user friendly than my old one. Customer Service for the Kindle is available 24/7 and they are very helpful. You can get a review about any book before you purchase it. No returning books to the library. Excellent value for small laptops. Lenovo 11.2\" screens with flash memory & Microsoft Word for 1 year. This is a new tab upgrade for me as I have had my previous Kindle for over 7 years and love it. Have been very pleased with all aspects of the Fire HD8. Good performance for the low price. This was a gift for my wife. She loves it. She uses it everyday. Holds a great charge. Great little product for the price. Not the best camera, but it doesn\\'t claim to be. . Nice tablet for the price. Just wish it had bluetooth. Can\\'t beat the price on this Fire Tablet HD8! Very good display. awesome gift and perfect for kids or older adults easy to use I had an older Kindle fire and had to upgrade as it eventually died. I love the convenience of books when I travel, along with any apps I want. exactly what I was looking for. My old tablet stopped working so the value of the Amazon Fire at Best Buy was too much to pass up Bought as a gift for my daughter. and s he loves it. I was reluctant to replace my previous Kindle Fire because I wasn\\'t sure I would like it as well. I am pleased to say I\\'m loving it! I bought Kindle fire for my grandson who is 24. I have one and he thought great can do so much on it. For the price you can\\'t beat it. I use more then computer. Use it for what it is necessary. That is all I need. Great Tablet for occasional users who want to Watch Movies, Read books, and browse the web. I already own one but bought another for my sister in law for Christmas. I have really enjoyed it so far. While not perfect by any means it is certainly worth the price. Works better than what I expected. Able to surf the net and watch movies. The battery life and screen are awesome. Bought this for under 60 bucks and looking to buy more to give as a gift I purchased the Fire Tablet to temporarily replace an iPad and an LG tablet that were destroyed. My 7-year-old won\\'t put it down--he can play all his favorite games, read Kindle books, and watch YouTube videos (as long as he has wi-fi access). It\\'s holding up well. Good price. I bought this for my wife. She had a Barnes and Noble Nook, this took it\\'s place. She uses the Kindle Fire daily from reading books and playing games to looking up things on the web. She lives it. The Amazon fire hd 8 is great. Much faster than the fire 7. I am really enjoying this device, I wanted something to use for entertainment purposes when camping. Something small yet powerful and this works perfect. 5 stars if your a prime member like me that way you can take advantage of the many thing prime has to offer yet still have available almost every other digital services out there. Would and have recommended this product. Tablet had trouble from the begging it kept restarting and rebooting I had to return it. if you like the old kindle fire it just like the new one but better, better screen and more space I\\'m not going to say this is the best tablet out there,but,for my wifes needs,it is perfect. It does everything she wants to do and more. Got it for $60 during black Friday. I also have 7inch fire tablet. For few more bucks this tablet is way better than the 7 inch non HD fire. I truly enjoy this product. I have an older one but this is superb in all areas of entertainment. Good tablet. Gave as gift and person enjoys it. Recommend I bought one last year for one cousin and had to continue for another this year. Great buy imo. it is small enough to carry in your purse and open up a whole new world while waiting at appointments. Looks pretty solid will update review as soon as gift is opened . We have one for each of my children so I bought this one for my mother. They are amazing tablets especially for the price! Purchased mainly to use travelling so haven\\'t really had the opportunity to give it a fair road test at this point. It was advertised as capable of downloading movies and books so you can watch/read while travelling without burning through your data or being hit with data roaming fees or having to purchase wifi during flights. Got these on black Friday for early Christmas gifts. Very good buy on a pretty good tablet. Gift for my mom and she had no problem learning to use. The best tablet for the price! All three of my children have one & they are worth it! Purchased as a gift for my nephew He\\'s was very happy with this item no complaints Works better than the 7\" Amazon Fire tablet I have. Better screen, faster processor and bigger to boot. I bought one for my boyfriend and one for his son. It\\'s fast and easy to use. This was a gift and they love it! Its compact, they can surf the web, play games check emails etc This my 2nd Kindle. I am so happy with it. The price was right and I could not resist buying another. I like it a lot, it works well for everything I need. I would like a bigger selection of apps. Bought this for someone as a gift. They are big on amazon kindle so this was a huge plus with other features and amazon store improving. They love it.I know other tablets have kindle apps but this was an awesome price. BOUGHT MINE ON BLACK FRIDAY AND IT IS AWESOME. MY FIRST TABLET AND IT IS GREAT WITH ALL OF THE AMAZON FEATURES. my kids have this. it works okay for things like youtube or netflix. Apps take longer to load and many games that you can get for the iPad aren\\'t available on the Fire Tablet. Still say go with Mac. So easy to use and can do so much more than just read on it I received this as a gift after my original Kindle Fire started giving me trouble after 4 1/2 years and wouldn\\'t hold a charge. This new Kindle Fire 8 is fantastic! The larger size makes it easier to read. The \"buttons\" are better than the old one. I like that is has more \"perks\", i.e. camera, that my old one didn\\'t have. It\\'s nice to be able to read, play games, browse the internet, or check email or take photos. The battery lasts for days! I definitely recommend this. Bought for college student as substitute for text books. Works great! This is a Christmas gift for my granddaughter. I purchased this one because I heard a lot of good things about it and the price was great on black Friday. Got a great deal on black friday. This is the best affordable tablet for under 100. Was able to get advertisements off from Amazon and installed playstore. Wife bought a cheaper cover for this tablet. Love the Amazon environment. Want to buy another one if they come down in price again! My two oldest (10 & almost 8) love these tablets and I love the FreeTime subscription from Amazon! My Aunt is 86 and has never used a computer. She does not have internet at her house. But she loves to read and loves to learn and now will be challenged while learning to use her new Kindle. If you are in the Amazon ecosystem, the Fire HD8 is a great choice for an inexpensive tablet. Very responsive, good screen, and so far the battery life has been great. The only drawback of the Fire is the apps are only available from the Amazon App Store, not the Google Play Store. For example, there is no Gmail application to install. But that\\'s not what I use this for... Kindle reading, Netflix viewing, occasional Facebooking and light web browsing are well suited to this device. Can\\'t beat it for $89. My whole family uses these tablets. We love them and with Prime it is awesome. I like this tablet it\\'s easy to use Easy for the kids It works just right. My husband loves it too. It does well with my kids. Runs Great, very efficient for what we use it for. Got everything on here and then some!!!!!!!!!!!!!! My kids have the older model fire, smaller version. They can spend hours on it. This is bigger, better version with a larger screen size. Each child is getting a different color so they know whose is which. Durable, works great enjoy using it for books and audio books I previously owned a Samsung Tab3. As a media device (for reading, viewing, listening, playing), the HD8 is fine, even a step up in screen size, clarity, and ease of navigation. However, the proprietary nature of Amazon\\'s apps basically eliminates (for me) using it for work (e-mail, document & spreadsheet storage/retrieval/editing). Since I didn\\'t buy it for its work capabilities, that\\'s fine, but I think that would be annoying to a specific segment of potential users. At some point I will probably spring for a more-expensive updated Samsung tablet (or Windows Surface, if I\\'m feeling reckless), and the HD8 will probably be passed on to my 9-year-old. I am so impressed with this tablet. My seven year old loves its app, gaming and e-reader functions. Easy to use reading device. Looking forward to watching movies on it. Great value My girl loved it, she loves that its linked to echo It\\'s was good for handling light weight and comfortable in hand. Good audio clarity, video everything is good. But only few supportable apps. Need more apps which we use generally. Great alternative to iPad Mini. Great for Amazon Prime members I had gotten this primarily to watch movies and run some basic internet programs. I have been very pleased to date with the speed of the processor and picture quality. Just what my grandson wanted. Perfect price, can\\'t wait until he opens it Has worked out well. Very user friendly. Would buy again. Great price as well. Great tablet for the money! Thought to beat the screen resolution My Kindle Fire HD meets my reading and web needs!! This is a great device for my sons games since he was always using my iphone. Lots of good features for the Amazon member. Tablet is nice and fast. Great tablet for under $100. HD quality and it works just as good as any tablet. Bought two for my grandkids, a 10 year old boy. He does a lot of AR reading on this kindle fire tablet for school. As well as play games. He loves it and his parents are pleased with his eagerness to read. Tablet work great, good battery life. Just not a lot storage, but has micro SD card slot. Was told by sales person I could come back in a week with receipt to get $30 off (Black Friday price). Customer service lady said they don\\'t do that. I was misled. Item itself is okay. Great Kindle, my wife had the originally one and this one is better in every way. I purchased this tablet on thanksgiving day when I was already in the store buying a new cell phone. It was on sale $59. I am very pleased with my purchase. I am already an Amazon prime member so it links up to my account. I am very happy with my purchase and recommended to my brother who bought the same day I did:) I really like the Fire 8 tablet but there are some issues to be aware of. Amazon seems to subsidize the low cost of the item by requiring you to be solicited by ads and and use their apps. Every time you activate it, the screen display is a full size ad that goes away when you swipe the screen. There is no Google Play so you can only download apps chosen by Amazon at their Appstore. Otherwise, pretty cool for the money. I got this for my birthday and I love it. I love the resolution, size and blue light setting. I am now thinking on buying one for my four year old nephew as a Christmas present, I only need to buy a sleeve. This is a great gift for my 6 year old nephew. He will enjoy it for hours. Clear screen, color and size, grandson loves to play games on it and I like to have it with me to view emails during commercials while watching tv. I need a table that had more memory to start with. This fit the bill. I had a kindle before but mine did not have a camera like this one . This make it easier to capture picture instead of having to stop and use my phone. Pros: 5 Ghz wifi, supports expansion cardsCons: app store a little limited though there is apparently a workaround Other: the ads fed from Amazon are not terribly intrusiveOverall, the tablet seems to work well and is a good value, This item is perfect for online reading and internet browsing. The only con is that Amazon doesn\\'t have some of the apps that Google Play has. The camera is not very sharp , and you can not download another one . Bought for my mom, shes in love with it. Use for netflix myself love the 8\\' great size and cpu speed. Love my new kindle bought it to replace a 7 inch and I love it. Love my Kindle. It has taken over the place of my laptop completely with all other added benefits. This is our 5th kindle. We love these. They are easy to use and the screen is a nice size. They are lightweight and great for reading. Works great even in OK network areas. Long battery life and easy to use. Would definitely recommend to a friend. I purchased this for my daughter for Christmas. I own one as well and I love it. First time with a tablet, wanted one for years just to watch Netflix and basic games. Very happy, the screen looks great and the speaker is loud. So far, so good! Great HD features. Makes it easy to travel with and be on the go and see all your shows. i like the tablet only thing is im not a fan of the amazon app store. wish it had google play. I know my granddaughter will love it. She has an older one that was given to her For the most part I like the tablet. Got it for my mother. The con is you have to use Amazon for apps. The amazon fire HD is great choice for a beginner or not so tech savy person! I like the low light mode the extra memory and a great price compared to the others This fits perfect in my purse and love how clear the screen is. The price was amazing, didn\\'t find it anywhere else close the the price. Nice tablet but as usual with these items no instructions on how to get started It\\'s very good product and I recommended this to buy it. Best bang for your buck............................ Excellent pick up during the Black Friday Sales. Not too big not to small. This tablet bundled up with Amazon Prime service is a great combo of inexpensive entertainment. I had a very small nano and needed to have more space for songs that are just coming out and so far I love it. Didn\\'t really need the bigger one because I have a phone that will do most of those things. Works very well for light tablet use and great for reading. Fire 8 HD 2016 is great. Very easy to maneuver. Easy to use and transition from original Kindle Fire. Much more versatile than the original. Really glad I upgraded. Ok tablet from amazon, added Google play to device for more apps. Google how to do this. I bought this item for my nephew and he loves it. I have the old version of the fire hd and I love it as well. It\\'s way cheaper than buying an apple tablet. We haven\\'t had any problems with it. Well worth your money Bought it for my daughter and she can\\'t put it down. Great for nextflix I had a kindle for about 4 years, I\\'ve been wanting a fire hd for sometimes, because of all the features. I can honestly say that I love my fire hd. still playing with it, figuring out what I can & can\\'t do. I love the tangerine color I got. One thing for sure, some apps I have on my phone like redbox & instagram they are not in the amazon app store so I can\\'t put them on the tablet. Wish I could. Working great as a first tablet for my grandson. He loves it Very fast tablet. Large screen but can held by 1 hand. Great for movies and videos, as well as candy crush and other resource hogging apps. It starts CC way faster than my LG G3 phone. The display is very clear and crisp. The amazon android modified OS is good once you get used to it. I have one screen containing all apps, and you can put these in groups too. so 1 screen is all you will need. then you have the other panels for Amazon mandated stuff like Prime movies, music, pictures. It\\'s pretty cool compared to my previous Acer 8\" tablet with reg Android. Could not easily install Chrome, but I\\'m getting use to the SILK browser and it will work very well for my needs. Great Tablet and highly recommended. Definitely an amazing deal at an amazing price on Black Friday weekend Amazing product from Amazon within budget and get the best outcome of it It was by far the best deal out there for the money very happy I purchased the Kindle Fire 8\" after owning a 7\" for several years. I love the bigger screen and added features in this version. Bought this for my daughter. It is inexpensive and user friendly. I use it all the time while she\\'s at school. Easy to use and elegant in design. Perfect Gift for Kids. Just decent tablet... working fast, but it needs more language support and apps as well... I bought the fire 7 inch last year and this one is better. My wife and kids love it. Easy to use. Great for the price. Good product I would recommend it to everyone thank you Thought this would be a great gift for the kids and the price was right I bought this on Black Friday for 60 bucks and wasn\\'t expecting too much at that price point. This isn\\'t as good as a iPad but at that price it\\'s pretty close and worth every penny. Bought this for a Christmas gift. Have heard good things about them and it was a recommended buy. It is awesome with low price and high quality. My daughters like it very much. Had just the fire like HD better. More movies and better quality. still learning, previously used a nexus7. Like the larger screen. Reading kindle books on it is good too. Bought for our 6 year old. Great parental controls allow you to keep track and monitor use. Would recommend for others to get for their children The product was on sale for Black Friday. Serves its purpose. Quality is good and I use it with my Chromecast. Makes a great gift. My children love them and never put them down. excellent tablet for this price is wonderfull and great performance Had to buy a new kindle because on my fire hd 7 the battery quit holding a charge. Was told there was nothing you could do. It\\'s easy to use. I can check my email, play games from AppStore, headlines news, amazon deals & offers. Very reasonable price. Purchased this for my grandson. It works great and is used mainly for reading and games. Easy to setup with no problems to register and get online. I love this tablet! love my ipad , too, but this is much lighter weight and easier to slip in my purse. I went for a 32g but there were none in stock, so I got the 16 and a memory card that I will probably never need! Love it fast , pictures look fab. love the battery life fast, easy to use, very sensitive, google play store captable, I will buy again Great tablet for the cost, does all the basic functions great. These are email, web surfing, and social media. If you belong to Amazon Prime then it\\'s even better since this thing makes it easy to take advantage of the extra content you can access. Movies, TV Shows, music, books. A lot of this is free for Prime Members. Good idea and business move for Amazon as it encourages Amazon content and purchases. The tablet itself is pretty good, smaller and more narrow than an iPad. Easy to hold in one hand, screen is nice for video, reading, web surfing and email. If the iPad is setting the bar and is a 10, I would give this an 7-8. The weakest thing is the camera, it adequate but you smart phone is better. A feature it has that the iPad lacks is the ability to add an Micro SD Card for extra space. It is also much cheaper than an iPad. I bought this for my 7 year old when her Samsung tablet stopped charging. I love the design. Only problem so far is that it randomly freezes and sometimes the volume button won\\'t respond. Other than that, great for the price. Fire tablets never disappoints! Great price, used my certificate points which helpedAlways best price at best but Most of the Kindles I have purchased have been gifts, but this one was for me. It is just what I expected from the reviews. Great tablet for the money. very good product in its price range affordable and very good The tablet works fine. But speakers are not that great If you want a good cheap tablet that works this is it. For the price guy cannot beat it great for watching videos or streaming television. I love the light weight for the size! Fun tablet!!! I really wanted to give this device a chance but I did end up returning it. It\\'s a HUGE upgrade though over the cheaper 7\" version. Honestly I don\\'t think anyone should purchase that. If your budget can handle getting this version and you are heavily invested in the Amazon ecosystem (i.e. Prime member) this will make a great tablet. I think it is intended more for kids though than adults. Having iPads in the house we tried this with our toddler as a cheaper tablet for her but the interface and quirks of the Amazon OS just were not worth the hassle. Will end up seeking out a used iPad Mini 2 instead of this. Inexpensive tablet. Funtional and great for reading. It has the blue screen that make it great for reading. Great graphics for price compared to other brands. Purchased for my nephew for Christmas. I know he will enjoy it. After I read the reviews there are a variety of things he can do on it for a 13 year old. Purchased this for my nephew for Christmas. After reading reviews, I think this will be a good device for reading books and listening to music. Upgraded from a6\" inch Fire HD. For 89.00 I don\\'t think you can find a better tablet value. Resolution is very sharp, audio is good, and it is a good size. My first tablet and it is just perfect for a beginner like me. Easy to use and just the right size. I use it when I just need to check something quickly on the internet without having to turn on my desk top computer. Very fast. great tablet for a great price and size. Would highly recommend ! Great over all Tablet! Good build quality, but cheap enough for the kids to use / loose. Really a plus for travel. Install VLC media player from the amazon app store, and then you have unlimited movie options for up to12 hours. Add some head phones and that 6 hour trip to Disneyland, well it\\'s so much more tranquil for the adults. The screen is a good size (portable but large enough to read) and has excellent resolution and color quality, the wireless connection is good and the user interface is relatively clear and easy to learn. Bought two of these for my grandson and grand daughter and they love them. I like the parental controls and the apps. Perfect device for my kids. Easy to use with lots of features. We had a few other tablets for my wife and all were very poor. We returned two and landed on this one, she has LOVED it, so much more than the others in this price range. I have had two previous kindles since they where first available. I really like all the new upgrades. The screen is very crisp and clean. The color is great. Much easier to look for books. This tablet is great! Nice display, and you get the amazon eco-system. Now you can also download google play easily, so you have the best of both worlds. I was unsure about getting a tablet but after purchasing the Amazon Fire I was convinced that I had made the right choice and have been very happy ever since. I was concerned that I had a lot to learn but it came quickly to me and I really like the screen size. It was a great buy! For the low price it is very speedy and has sufficient storage space.While it doesn\\'t have Google play, the Amazon app store has most of the same apps or a workable alternatve. We are really pleased with this tablet. The color is great. At this price point it is very good. But having being used ipad the display doesnt look sharp. Amazon app store lacks content. Overall good for my 9 yr old. This is a great tablet!!! I absolutely would recommend it to a friend!! I would buy it again!! The tablet works good.. good price point .. would buy again I enjoy readi,g and Facebook using this item. I also purchased my husband one. I love my fire! Does all that I need it to and more!!!! However only four stars because I can\\'t get rid of the ads on my lock screen unless I pay $15. it does have a lot of glare but I don\\'t mind the glare too much! Speed is great lots of storage!; This table is great for social media like facebook, check emails, watch YouTube , and in general good enough for the price! It works great for all my needs to check my emails A little more space on outer edges would be great. I only use it for gaming and have had 1 real problem. At times it kicks me out of the game (popular game from EW) Otherwise great for what I do. Needs more security. But overall good purchase for less than 100$. For the price you really can\\'t beat this tablet. The picture looks good, amazon has a great game, movie and music catalog. So if your looks big for something just to view movies on, play games or surf the web get this one because for the price it can\\'t be beat! Brought it for my son & Does EXACTLY what i want it to do. Bought this as a replacement for the 7\", faster and better display.... Best upgrade I wanted something bigger than my phone for reading. I was looking at the kindle fire, and the regular kindle e-readers. I liked the paperwhite and voyager, but they didn\\'t have the ability to play audiobooks. I decided to go with the fire because even though it will be mostly used for reading, I can do many other things with it for a cheaper price. love it i got it for my kids its more durable than a apple table I love the product. I\\'m very happy but I would like even more if the page number was displayed when reading books on this tablet, in case I wanted to refer back to a certain page. upgraded my 3 year old kindle- same old. doesnt seem that great of a difference. the graphical interface still sucks but its decent for reading. I have been a Kindle Fire user for years. This new one is amazing. I like being able to store information on a SD card. We like the battery endurance. The new 8\" screen is great too. I am very happy with this tablet. It\\'s a good size for me and easy to read and use. The wifi would drop often to where I could not listen to Spotify or other services without buffering. I was contemplating to buy either the insignia 10.1 or the Fire Hd8, I\\'m so glad I chose the latter. It is so fast and sufficient for my needs. I also downloaded Google play on the tablet even making this a better purchase. For $59, you can\\'t go wrong with this purchase. Its cheap, but the you will notice the low screen resolution compared to iPad. App is somewhat limited unless you side load it. Went in to look at the 10\\' Kindle Fire and couldn\\'t resist the price on this one. There wasn\\'t a big enough size difference to justify spending more than 200.00 for the 10 inch. This has been a great device so far. Battery life, ease of use, etc I had to return my device due to WIFI signal dropping, maybe I just had a bad unit. I\\'m disappointed that it doesn\\'t have a mirror display mode. I purchased this for my dad as a birthday present. I opened it and set it up for him and it works great. It\\'s fast enough for an Internet browser, and possibly a student. I have been wanting to purchase a tablet for light web browsing, reading, and to watch videos, something easier to carry than my laptop. This tablet is fast & the videos stream in great (as long as you have good Wi-Fi connection). Easy access to Amazon too. First, I would like to say I own iPads, iPhone, and many things Apple. Second, I also own many android devices. The main reason for this tablet was to take advantage of the lending library that comes Amazon prime. Over all I would purchase this over an iPad mini any day just for the value alone. At first I thought the display wouldn\\'t be up to snuff compared to my iPad, but for movies and reading, it was good enough that it doesn\\'t take away from the experience. However, there are a few annoying \"features\" that are on but can and should be turned off. The \"on-deck\" is a great feature, but I would have liked to have known it was downloading tons of movies in the background, eating up space and bandwidth. A better function would have been to let us choose what to download, instead of getting movies Willynilly. Be sure to turn this off when you get your tablet or it will run slow, and you\\'ll be thinking the tablet is slow. Ok on to kindle for reading. Unfortunately, reading isn\\'t as great as I thought it would be because it doesn\\'t allow scrolling. Works on kindle devices but not on kindle fire devices. If you don\\'t mind flipping the page, then you won\\'t have a problem, but for me, can read much faster by scrolling. One last point, most of the apps aren\\'t as polished under the \"Amazon Store\" as in the Google play store. I know this because I have an Nexus phone and compared them. For example, the Hue app doesn\\'t even work from Amazon Store. Anyway, this point shouldn\\'t deter you from buying it cause there are solutions. Bought this for my father who would have trouble using a computer. He\\'s picking up on it very quickly. It keeps him entertained. Good reliable device. it would be nice to have full app library, but it does what you need This is a great tablet for kids and adults alike.! Got this for my 3 year old and 7 year old and they love it. I have education apps and books that reads to them or they can read along. I would recommend getting a case for it if it\\'s for the little ones just to keep it protected. impulse purchase but a good one. good fit with amazon account that we already had. nice screen, easy to navigate This gift was for my mother in law. Initially I had to help her set it up, but she loves it and can now program it all by herself. Recommeneded! For its price, this a great little tablet. It does have limitations on what it can do and what apps are available for use with it which is the only reason I gave it 4 rather than 5 stars. Hopefully Amazon will allow it to perform better soon. This suited my exact needs which was a mobile way of watching netflix. I thoroughly enjoy this table! Easy to operate, plenty of memory, and I can use it for anything that I typically use a computer for. Great for airline flights, viewing offline amazon or Netflix shows and reading books. Video quality fine for personal viewing. It has been one of the best purchases ever. It is very simple to use. This is my first android tablet. It works pretty good though don\\'t expect it to work like an iPad. The ads are extremely annoying, but that\\'s not Best Buy\\'s fault. For me this tablet is an extremely good value! iPads are beautiful things, and they seem to just work really well all the time. But they are expensive! Same thing with Android tablets. You can get a cheap Android tablet, but then you\\'re left with a cheap tablet...poor quality displays, questionable hardware, limited support. I think Amazon hit the spot with their line of Fire Tablets - this HD8 in particular. It\\'s good quality, has a great display, it\\'s quick and snappy, has great battery life. Also being an Android based operating system, there is flexibility like accessing storage, side loading third party apps, even installing Google Play (for those who begrudge the lack of that feature, it can be done). Much more flexibility than you get with an Apple product, at a much lower price than the industry standard Samsung etc. Coming from using Apple products for so long, this thing is really convincing me that there are really viable options other than Apple, and especially for the price, its a great introduction to a different platform. Not only that, it\\'s genuinely a good product! The tablet works great so far. The parent features are nice also. suggested by the sales associate I\\'m glad I took his suggestion I gave this Amazon Fire HD8 as a retirement gift for my friend and she absolutely loves it!! Bought it for my daughter and she loves it great product at a great price! Easy, fast and efficient.great lil tablet in this price range for anyone. Purchased the Amazon Fide HD8 as a gift for my dad, who has been overjoyed with it. The display looks great and it offers him access to many of the features he looks for in a tablet, from e-books, streaming video or online shopping. The price is low because Amazon\\'s OS is restrictive, but for simple or specific needs, this product is great. Got this for my wife. She uses it daily to read She really lokes it. great tablet for kids, and for the price a great value. This is a great tablet for the price. I have one that I purchased a few years ago and use it much more than my laptop. Recently purchased two more for gifts. Does the job when I travel and I would recommend to a friend This is my fifth Kindle and with each new one I have a new feature to use. I like my tablet. Been doing a lot more reading than normal with it. Only disspoinment is that my TV has automatic Chromecast and you cannot cast to it on my Toshiba TV. Works on others. TVs. I like it. Perfect tablet for my 8 year old without spending a fortune. I love how it has parental controls so I can limit his time playing. Used for reading and surfing the web, this tablet is great for all. Great screen clarity. Purchased the tablet because it was a very reasonable price. It has ended up being a good tablet. I bought this for my mom because she is too scared to even use her laptop. I thought this looked more user friendly since she knows my 5 year old nephew can use an iPad. I purchased several of these tablets during the holidays as gifts. Everyone absolutely loves the FireHD8, especially those with the prime memberships. My only regret is not purchasing one for myself. I bought this for husband for Christmas. He loves it. It fits his needs perfectly. I would recommend this product. Great product. Device performed as described. Great reviews. It\\'s easy to use and my son likes to play on it alot I bought this for my 86 year old father. he loves it. finds it very easy to use perfect gift perfect price for my wife to bring her into the technilogical modern world we live in Enjoying the kindle reading watching movies playing games Convenient and easy for my 10 year old to use to do homework on. We like it!! Would buy again.Still learning about it\\'s features. Good value Bought it for my 89 year old mom. She has enjoyed reading on it. Easy to use I needed to upgrade from the orginal Kindle fire and this Fire works great. Videos,games, email and battery life all are great. Works as expected. I enjoy reading newspaper articles, books, as well as banking apps and social media tools. I like this tablet. I had a nook, the fire has more memory, bigger screen and lower price. The downside? The Amazon Fire is so ridiculously proprietary that I cannot watch any of my movies on it from my nook. This is becoming industry standard. Too bad. I installed a driver for google play store; also I payed amazon to get rid of the lock screen ads ($15). It was worth it. I use this thing alot. Easy to use, great battery life, plenty of space and amazing screen quality. Excellent product. The screen is very easy to read and can access movies, books, and ,more. Was given as a gift to my mother and she loves it. This tablet was great. I bought it for my sister on christmas and she loves it. It is great for surfing the web and watching videos. The sound and screen quality are great and I like the blue light cutoff feature.I found that toggling back & forth online to be clumsy compared to a tablet.It is lightweight and easier to handle for long periods of time. The tablet is good for games like solitaire or other app games, and of course for books. But for internet or other applications, it would not be the top choice. Good buy for the money. My wife reads a ton, she uses it everyday. She\\'s owned others and this is by far the best. This tablet is hands down the best investment I\\'ve ever made. I used to carry a laptop to meetings, then my kids talked me into getting a tablet and what a difference. As long as there is wifi it does everything my laptop will. Hoping for an updated hdx kindle, but settled for this. Enjoy the expanded sd slot. very pleased with my amazon tablet. starting with the price ,ease of use, and size. Good cheap tablet. Great for Netflix and YouTube. Screen is a decent size just bigger than a phone and smaller than a laptop. It\\'s also HD which is a plus We love our tablets waiting recommend it to my friends Purchased to replace the one I bought for my brother in August (physical damage). This time, bought the extended warranty. No issues or claims so far! I think the amazon fire offer should include a stand/cover as standard. I enjoy mine a lot more since I was forced to purchase a stand/cover which holds the tablet. Would have preferred an instruction sheet to grt everything set up for use. Easy to access the apps, but not always easy to quit. The device works good, but since it\\'s the apps that make it what it is, more attention should be given to their operation. I was disappointed that it did not come with even a basic user\\'s guide. We are a total Apple family so I was a little hesitant to purchase this when our iPad stopped working. So glad we did because it\\'s perfect and can\\'t beat it for the price! Love using my new tablet (Amazon Fire). Easy to use. Great buy! Good value value for the money & easy to use. Bought this for my dad food Christmas and he loves it. This is a great option for a first tablet. It\\'s lightweight and user friendly. This is just an awesome tablet for the price and the features it has This little thing does everything and does it quickly. It could use a case, so think about getting one, but as an eReader it does everything it is supposed to. I so happy I can recommend this good thanks Best Buy is the number one I think I downloaded 6 new apps. I wait to surf the web. This thing is so slow to respond. My old refurbished iPad is better. I really only bought it to stream Hulu and Netflix. I\\'m not excited about lighting up the home screen to find advertisements every day, but I guess you get what you pay for. I wanted inexpensive, I got it! Don\\'t buy this if you are used to using quick responding electronics. My 10 year old uses it at school to scan qr codes and do his online math. Santa got this for my 7year old. Work\\'s great . He plays, games, gets on hulu, and can play his school education learning games. Now he doesn\\'t bother me to use my electronic devices . I have always been an iPad user but I love the kindle fire 8. It has everything you need and more and so much less expensive. Battery lasts a long time but I actually like my old Fire more. We got this for a young girl who is 9. She loves it and there a lot of Apps that she likes. There are parental controls which is a plus, recommend for almost any age group. I got everything I need for personal use. A great value for a cheap price. This was a perfect gift for my friend. Obsessed with reading and has been perfect for starting a greater library of books... Very easy to use and extremely affordable. Very happy with this purchase, and will buy more for family and friends! I love it for reading magazines and checking my email. This tablet is sturdy and great for my kids with games and learning. I love my kindle fire it holds a library of books that I can read anywhere. I change from my kindle fire to my phone if I don\\'t have the kindle with me. So I can start right where I am in the book and then finish up on my kindle fire when I can. I play games and listen to books all on this device. Love it It\\'s good for doing a number of basic tasks. The Amazon Underground feature is really cool. It feels like an Android but more limited. Great for reading e-mail, pictures or viewing internet. Great item, I can say it feel just like working with an iPad. Picture, sound, size and touch are very sweet. this is a great tablet for under $100 and you can add kodi on it, to me thats the best feature and the duel sided camera Got this as a gift for my Mom who reads a ton. She loves it for reading and great portability. Great tablet for the price. Great for media consumption. Screen seems sharp enough unless you get unbearably close to it. Wifi connectivity is good. Speakers sound poor but I didn\\'t expect any better from an 80$ tablet. Have had this tablet since November and is still going strong. Only complaint is the slow charging. but it isn\\'t too bad. This is a nice compact size, and is very user friendly! .Great resolution. Camera quality not so good tho. Gave it one less star for the camera. But overall its a great tablet I love it a lot and use it daily, bought books.... I got theses tablets for my grandkids for Christmas, they love them. My granddaughter loves her tablet. She has learned how to play both educational and recreational games. Will be very helpful in the future. Great tablet for the price easy set up and app and data transferring from the original Fire. My 5 yr old loves it, however we do experience some sound issues from time to time. This was purchased for my 9 year-old to play games, watch movies, and read on. When we set it up, I was extremely impressed with the quality that we got for the price! It\\'s processor is fast enough so that his games run smoothly. Setup was a breeze, and it\\'s very sturdy. This is a great lower price tablet for anyone looking to own a nice tablet for an extremely affordable price. Purchased for 4 yr old granddaughter who primarily uses for Netflix. Works great! the fire tablet is a nice size and is easy to use it is better then the 7in fire Not much to say here. Cheap, fast and very functional. I was able to install google play store and everything works perfectly. Best tablet in its category. If you want something better, you better be ready to pay 3-4 times the price. This tablet exceeded my expectations. Strong processor, nice screen. Wish it had Bluetooth and was not so centered around Amazon prime. Great item. My teen lives it. This item offers more than just reading. Tablet was college student. Replace a bulky laptop. Good for taking notes, reading text books and regular books. Loud alarm to wake college student for early classes. All a round got tool for school. its very easy to set up and use. love to take it with me . screen its large enough to read easy on it my 7\" wore out,my 8\" is much better,allthough the covers are expensive and screen protectors are hard to find. the battery life is exceptional ! Was looking for a tablet with expandable memory that was reliable. Amazon Tablet was the best choice Very easy to use. Size is just right --not cumbersome at all. Cannot beat the value and features that this product offers for the low price point. The Amazon-Fire is an inexpensive WiFi device we use for answering messages and is quickly shifted from person to person as well as moved from room to room. This tablet absolutely surprised me. The screen is awesome and the battery life is great. I love the Fire HD. Went back and bought the Fire 7\" for my wife that afternoon! I\\'ve had multiple Amazon Fire tablets. They are a great bargain. I love the ease of use and functionality. The only downfall is that it is really slow to charge. This was an awesome tablet purchased for my seven year old daughter for Christmas. Initially, I was looking to purchase the iPad mini but unfortunately they were sold out. This was my alternative and I am so glad I did. The price was perfect and the internet and app access have been great! She loves it! The only thing she misses is the FaceTime but it has not been a big deal at all! Gecksqd. Helpful in understanding different things . Upgrade from old Kindle Reader whose charger quit working android system easy to use I really like the value of this Fre. It is thin, light, and has all the features of those higher priced tablets. A good camera lens....and access to amazon deals make this well worth $69. Try it! Got this for my mom. Decent tablet not heavy and good pirce. She loves it. Great tablet - lag free when running apps... Good battery life. Only downside is lack of ability to screen mirror. Was available on older versions but no longer My father upgraded from the original Kindle Fire to this model, and he\\'s very happy with it. It doesn\\'t compete with more mainstream tablets, but he likes the Kindle\\'s system for downloading library books. Gave as Gift. the recipient powered down his IPad, and is giving it away. I bought this for my wife, this is her third Amazon Fire tablet. She mostly uses it for reading but she really likes the speed and the additional features on this one. She\\'s very happy with it Very bright display, speedy processor, and solid feel. Impressed. I bought this item as a Christmas gift for my granddaughter and she has loved every minute of it. It is intuitive, easy to use and she has it in her hands several times every day for everything from research for school to reading a book. Paw Paw hit a homer with this one! It was great product. the price which I got it was great. There\\'s different things my daughter can do,on it, plus I can read on it as well. It\\'s easy and intuitive. The only criticism is that it should be easier to go right into an application, instead of watching an advertisement, then having to figure out how to exit it Our first tablet. Purchased for my husband prior to a long train trip. Downloaded movies had Internet and was great for traveling. Works flawlessly. Good contender to my brother\\'s iPad. Much cheaper in price. Win for me. I purchased this for my mom for Christmas and she loves it! The amazon kindle is nice, portable and very easy to use. I bought this as a Christmas gift for my 8 year old. I was a big hit. I love the 8\" screen. The price was perfect for my budget. Great price for the internal memory size. If you are looking for a good tablet, this is it! I bought this for my 8 year old. I was a great buy. The price was affordable compared to other tablets on the market and e 8\" screen is perfect. Another great buy!!! I have an original Kindle Fire and am really enjoying my new updated version. Larger screen and very easy to navigate. I was given a fire when I was recuperating from spine surgery a few years ago. I used it for everything for quite some time. This one has a camera and plays all the latest files. I still have and use the old one as well. An excellent content delivery system. I got it with Best Buy customer appreciation money...what a deal! We purchased this as a gift. Researching and word of mouth led us to purchase this one. Very user friendly. The UI experience is great, especially for Prime members. The tablet is quick and responsive with plenty of memory to ha for any task. bought this for my elderly mother to play games, get email and pics via Instagram, etc. now she\\'s a geek! easy to use, even for a novice and very reasonably priced. Great buy, highly recommend this. Purchased this as a Christmas gift for my girlfriend. She absolutely loves it and uses it every day. She\\'s very picky about electronics and she loves her tablet so it must be good! It was a gift. The individual thoroughly enjoys it. the kindle is a great tool especially for the money. Fast processing, great screen clarity. Highly recommended This is my third Kindle (second Fire). I use it constantly primarily for reading electronic books. Currently have over 350 books in Kindle library. Like it best when traveling as I don\\'t have to carry a bunch of hardback books with me. Anywhere I go where I know there will be a waiting line (haircut, doctor\\'s or dentist\\'s office) I have it with me and use it productively to read.. The Fire HD is a nice tablet that functions well but doesn\\'t meet the shear horsepower and feel of an iPad....but, at about 1/4 the cost, it fits the bill pretty well. Great price. Easy start up easy to use.. large memory Great product I love that I can read all my books on here and search the internet! Being able to sign in and not have to do any setting up makes this device super user friendly! Love the tablets. Light, Good battery life, and fast performance. It was a fast deliver, the tablets is awsomo and it\\'s a great service My 15 year old is curious about adult material. But with this tablet you can control so much of the content he sees. You can even control how much he learns before watching videos and games. The Kindle/Amazon Fire HD Tablet is not a high priced item but it is everything I want from a tablet. Easy to use, easy to read and easy to pay for. A great tablet Best tablet hands down. Bigger screen and great new features. Has Alexis also. Lots of storage as well. I love this tablet. The size fits perfectly in one hand. The display is wonderful and the loaded apps have me reading again. It is the absolute best! Small and compact, surprisingly good image and sound. Having family members who lose cables all the time, this is a great deal. Reliable cable for the iphone at an affordable price. Plus the various cable colors allow me to assign colors for a person or charging station so we know when someone \"barrows\" a cable. I am satisfied with my products. I look weekly for a good deal. I look forward to more deals With a little tweaking you can install Playstore without rooting. It\\'s a great tablet, excellent color, fast, and battery lasts a very long time. Bought this table for my 4 and 9 year old for Christmas. They love them! It is a reliable easy to use tablet. Holds charge well and provides for my needs. I bought this for my girlfriend as a Christmas Present. She is a avid reader and has been using our ipad to read online library books. She asked me for a nook reader, but after seeing the fire....it was a no brainer to go in that direction. it is used everyday and she loves it. My grandson love this tablet alot of great games and learning activities. This smokes the Fire 7 which I picked up last year. Powerful and great screen for streaming...cannot go wrong for the price. Bought for my 7 yr old. Quality product at an affordable price. Bought on sale for $69.99. I would recommend this anytime as it\\'s a great product it\\'s For the money the Kindle Fire is the best tablet on the market. I wish I didn\\'t buy my I pad already I would have got one of these for myself. this does everything and more the older, more expensive Kindles. I\\'m not sure I need my ipad or laptop any more. My son loves it. There are a lot of kid friendly apps available. Purchased this for my 83 year old mother to primarily use as an e-reader. It seems as this may be easier for her to see than an actual book. She does not always find new technology easy to use, but seems to be doing ok with this tablet. She also is using it to play solitaire and possibly some other games. I left my 7 on airline flight and bought the 8 to replace love love the speed and the video on it. Glad I bought it is worth it!!!! the download speed has improved very much!! I was surprised on how easy it was to use. I bought it for my mother and she totally loves it, and I do too! Oh my, oh my, oh my! Amazon can do no wrong! This device is my precious! Purchased this for my wife during Christmas and got a great deal on it. Compared to the older version that she has this model is faster, brighter, and more convenient with Alexa. I would recommend this product looking for a tablet with lots of features packed in it. Purchased the device for my neice, she loves it, highly recommend Price/Quilty this thing is a no brainer. Awesome portal into the Amazon world. My wife uses this for playing on line games. She loves it I thought about purchasing a Samsung tablet also, however I do like to read as well. I saw several reviews that have a negative view because of the Amazon software and that it is not stock Android.However, I have installed the Play Store (you can find instructions online) and I am very happy with this tablet. I would definitely recommend it. Also I have had 10\" tablets before, and this one is just the right size. Bought this to update the old one we have and so far it\\'s been a good buy. Great screen resolution and easy to use. Battery life is really good. This was the perfect tablet for my wife for Christmas, she loves it. Easy to navigate and plenty of room for her favorites! Size, brightness, and convenience are good. The option to link with android products for messages is a little hard. I bought this for Christmas and my 10 year old loves it!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I need a tablet to begin exploring google and kindle fire was a great choice. Got this tablet for my mom who isn\\'t very tech savvy. She loves it. Can\\'t beat the price I am very impressed with this tablet. It is faster than some iPads I have used. I gave this as a gift and my Mother-in-law loves it. Thank you Hands down a great update to my first gen Kindle. Worthwhile! Cheaper than the paper white and has more abilities I bought this to replace an older model and am very happy with the product. Mostly used for reading but also for surfing the web, facebook, etc. Love it!! Got this as a gift for my mother and she\\'s satisfied This was a gift for my wife and she loves it!! It is much better than the old one Bought for my daughter instead of an I-pad. Works well, love the Amazon Underground App Store, but battery life doesn\\'t seem to last as long as older I-pads. Easy enough though for a child to use. Got it on sale and it\\'s good for what you pay for instead of paying a lot of money on an iPad. this electronic book reader is great, able to read ebooks, watch movies, play games. or browse the internet. it lets you hookup to any internet connection you want to use as long as its range Does a good job of performing basic functions and provides a good amount of entertainment. Good for watching movies or playing simple games or performing simple tasks. Looks good. Seems like it is well made and of good quality materials. Have not had any problems. Battery life is great for the price. Amazon sells a quality product. I am happy to get this product and i would also recommend this to my friends Last got Fire 7\" for my kids, with an Amazon Freetime subscription. These are very good for the price with two flaws: The screen is good and much better than other Android devices at 7\" but not great, and got the 8 Mb version with I would not recommend in hindsight. Because Android\\'s sub-par management on SD cards, got these this year. It has a much better screen, not only larger but with better resolution, adequate speakers for its price, it\\'s fast enough and overall more enjoyable to use. 16 Gb is the minimum I\\'d recommend, even with SD cards because some apps just work better with internal storage, and some apps even stored in SD will still use some amount of internal storage.It also has Alexa voice support.The main reason for these tablets in my case is the Freetime subscription that has unlimited access to thousands of age-appropriate books, hundreds (or thousand) of free apps and heavily curved web access per age presets. Amazon Fire OS has a decent support for multi-user and in particular kids accounts. My kids are 7 and 9. They spend a lot of time on games as expected but also read a good amount of books. As far as functionality it works well. I can surf the internet, match movies, check social media, and anything else a tablet is supposed to do. The app store has a good variety off apps. It does not have as many as the iTunes store, but there is plenty of variety. The reason I knock a star off is the constant ads. I know that this is an Amazon product, but the ads get a little annoying. I DON\\'T USE MUCH OF THE APPLICATIONS BUT IT WORKS FOR THINGS I NEED. If your looking for a great tablet without the high price this is the tablet for you... My wife loves her new Fire 8 tablet. It is easy to use and rubs quickly and smoothly,. Bright screen, lightweight, great price, I love it! It is a very nice tablet, but the 10 inch tablet seems faster and easier to enjoy for the price Really wanted a tablet that was near the nexus 7, but didn\\'t have too much bulk! I looked at the Nvidia Shield as well, and ended up settling on the Fire HD. Tremendous resolution, great battery life, and very easy to use. Highly recommend to anyone that wants a portable tablet for reading, watching videos/movies, and gaming. The first tablet I bought was good at first until it stops charging. I went to best buy to check it and they said that everything is okay. We tried it again at home and it was the same thing, it charged for a few min until probably 2% and will stop. I brought it back to the store and they replace it with a new one. So far I don\\'t have problem with it as well as the other 2 tablets that I bought together with the first tablet. It\\'s alright to browse the Internet and watch videos. Works great and has an excellent screen size. You cannot go wrong for the price unless you need to install google apps. Amazon blocks them although I have heard there are work arounds. Great product, good speed, nice resolution for the price. I have only had this Amazon Fire Hd8 since December 6, 2016 and it has already quit charging. It was easy to set up and use and the screen is big enough to play games on Its a nice tablet however it could be better but you get what you pay for My grandbabie love their kindles this is the 8th Kindle I buy for them I bought this for my son as a first tablet. I am impressed by the built-in parental app. It has a good level of control that I feel comfortable with. My son likes his Kindle. I think he will like it more when he gets used to having to get through the \"educational\" features before he can play. I admittedly need to explore the tablet more myself. That will enable me to customize the settings and the apps for him and myself. First experience with a tablet for my husband who likes it and uses it all the time. We like it. I bought this for my niece for a Christmas gift.she is 9 years old and she love it. My old Kindle was not working so good anymore so bought this one on a Black Friday Deal from Best Buy. Price was great. The only problem I had was that at times it did not seem to be charging well or fast. I took it back to Best Buy and they would have replaced it for me but then would have lost all progress in games I had played. The person at Tech Support suggested that I change the plug in \"brick\". He said that they have had problems with that. I can use the same plug that I use for my iphone and now it charges fine. Glad that it was an easy fix. Love the 8 inch HD tablet. Great colors on screen. Not cheaply built like some. This is the best tablet you can get for under $100. I have used or own many tablets including Ipad Pro/Mini, Samsung Galaxy Tab and Nexus. They are popular high-end tablets but easily cost over $300 or $400. I was very surprised by quality of this tablet and it gives you much more than what you pay. Battery performance is great- it easily lasts over 10 hours after charge. Speakers are solid with two drivers. Performance is decent although not as fast/responsive as high-end tablets. I was bit disappointed at its low contrast display. However for its price, I cannot complain too much. I purchased two of these tablets as a gift for Christmas. It has an exceptional HD screen which provides rich colors and makes it easy for those that like to read book, articles etc. One of the best tablets. Good for watching YouTube and reading as well. This Kindle is the right size for travel, yet large enough to read. Love all the features and price! Kindle Fire HD8 is great! Love the the size and the graphics. Easy to use and navigate. Perfect gift for mom! The battery life is great.Last on a bus trip to kept he quiet. I got this for my wife and she loves it. Great speed and display Gift for our son and he is really enjoying it. He can read as well as play games. I use this tablet as an e-reader and to listen to prime music at the same time. Great for this.Still leaning other features. I got this mainly to watch tv/movies. Battery life is best of all devices I have used to date. Enjoyed the Kindle 7 and now this better version as well. Purchased this on sale for my son. He and I use the tablet to watch movies, play games, read books, and browse the Internet. It\\'s great for the price we paid. If you\\'re a fan of Amazon, you automatically have apps for their services.The downside is you are not able to use google apps and the adds that appear from Amazon when you turn the device on. Really a nice item ..works wonderfully ..for the cost it\\'s a bargain Great product for the price! Works great and comes with ample storage. My kids really like this and if your buying a tablet for kids it\\'s worth it, but maybe not so great for adults. this tablet is excellent i use it on the couch inthe bedroom and in the car too i simplty love it Great resolution, easy to use. Amazon Prime gives you free movies, books, and games! This tablet was a Christmas gift for my dad. It has great resolution and is easy to use. With Amazon prime you get free movies, books, and games. I would highly recommend. We bought this tablet for our 4 year old to play games and watch Netflix. He loves it and at this price point, we\\'re not overly concerned if he damages it. We bought a nice foam case that keeps it well protected. We\\'re highly satisfied. Very good picture and it even takes pictures which is awwsome. You even get a free month of Amazon prime which came in very handy around Christmas Time My daughter loves this tablet! She plays multiple games and has taken video. Easy to use and the color is very vivid! Screen size good for older people. Great resolution and easy to use. Seems to work well. Screen quality is good. Like the size. I had been thinking about getting a reader for a while but did not know which one I wanted. As I looked at and tried several, I thought the Kindal Fire was the one I wanted. After discussing the features of the product with a salesperson, I decided.that it was the reader I wanted. It has turned out to be just what I wanted. Great value for the money. However, the operating system is a bit clunky. Constant notifications and messages to delete. Some can be turned off, other seem to just keep appearing. The reader app surprisingly is less than intuitive. I bought this for my son after he broke his iPad, and I am so glad I did!! It has unlimited games and books, which has made such a huge difference in his desire to read!! Love love this tablet!!! Bought this during black friday for $60. while I\\'m skeptical at first, it turns out to be a solid tablet for everyday use. Not to mentioned the great low price! I love the size of this tablet. I have an Ipad and think I prefer this size. It\\'s easy to carry and a great size for reading. Got it for Christmas and am loving it! I haven\\'t tried to take any pictures yet and I didn\\'t really purchase it for taking photos. I saw the reviews before purchasing and they were not good regarding photo quality. Again, that was not my purpose so am not too concerned at this time. The size and price makes this a best buy! I\\'m very pleased with my tablet I am thrilled with this purchase! Both affordable and high quality! I will try again for the 3rd time with my new Amazon Fire. It seems to have nice upgrades. This tablet works as well or better than my iPad. It is quicker and simpler to use with better speed and reaction. Pros:Great value for moneyEnough power to handle lot of Android gamesDecent battery lifeCons:Feels slow after using for a few weeksLow-resolution screen and camera. This is almost as good as my iPad mini. i love my apple iPad however this is a great backup. Tablet is great does everythimg as it should. Great entry level tablet This game seems to be another good addition to the Pokemon craze. My son got this for Christmas and has played it often since. He says that it\\'s \"awesome\", which is high praise indeed. So much better than my previous kindle, I\\'ve used my new kindle daily and I\\'m not much of a tech person. It is light weight and easy to navigate. The battery holds a good charge as well I was looking to purchase a tablet for my kids so they could work on homework. This is just what they need in terms of capability and size. It is a great tablet for the price. The 8 inch Fire is s great reader, 5 star. The only down side are limited add on applications. This tablet is so easy to set up and use. Very intuitive! Love love this device and all of my books can be transferred from my old version! Awesome The reader was easy to setup for a novice reader and email user. 2nd kindle bought as a gift. Easy to operate, can fit in my purse and eliminates having to carry around multiple traditional books. I gave this to my 6-year old for Christmas and it has been the perfect gift. Great price point (compared to an ipad) that can function for exactly what she needs. Screen is good . Lack of Google play kinda hurts but you will survive. The issue of back buttons or multifunction buttons is that sometime they don\\'t appear when you need them.. as they are part of the screen . So you have to kinda summons them which is a pain It\\'s a good tablet for the value. Downside is there\\'s no Google Play Store access. So you\\'re limited to apps in the Amazon app store. This is my first Android tablet. I have used numerous Apple iPad\\'s though.The only thing I have been dissatisfied with is that there isn\\'t an Instagram app available but that doesn\\'t have anything to do with Amazon or Kindle. Got one for myself and one for my son. Like the parental settings available. No more inappropriate youtube videos. Fast, great screen and appreciate the blue light setting especially at night. I purchased the HD 8 to use as a viewer for my Pearl RearVision camera, which requires dual band Wi-Fi and Blue tooth. I installed the programs & got everything up and working beautifully. However I was so impressed with its features, performance, and ease of use, that I\\'ve added a 128 gb MicroSD card so I can download Amazon videos for my grand kids to watch while we are on the road. The price was terrific as well, but comes with the cost of \"free\" ads when the you turn on the tablet. (FYI the tablet mounts magnetically to the vent holder and is removed when not in use.) If you are looking for an entry level tablet, this is it.The Kindle fire HD is perfect for kids! My daughter gets great use with this tablet. She loves to read so she gets best of both worlds. She can get her books and surf the web. Fsntastic buy Excellent value for my 3 yr old, everything you need plus HD and the wife can order off amazon prime, so happy wife and kid for the price cant beat it, 2nd one I have owned.... The Amazon HD 8 is by far the best budget tablet. If you just need a tablet to browse the web and watch videos this tablet is the way to go! That being said, it is fairly slow but who cares if you do not use the tablet for photo/video editing, gaming, picture taking, etc... I bought this for my mom. She loves the convince of reading her books on there This product is easy to use and take along with you I previously owned the Fire HD 7 and was excited about the HD 8. After getting the HD 8 and using it I started to notice how they were able to cut costs. The screen was not as crisp, the processor was slower and the speakers were not as loud as previous versions. Overall a good buy for the price but if you are expecting the quality that went into previous versions look elsewhere. Great for taking on trips. 16 GB, camera, computer The Amazon Fire HD8 is a great buy, very inexpensive but delivers great quality. Give a 4 rating and not 5 because there are advertisements on lock screen. Some may welcome the ads others not. Overall this tablet is great. Battery life is several days with very minimal usage. Battery lasts 7 to 12 hours with average usage including video. This Fire tablet is overall a good size, and has great features! We got this for our 9 yr old daughter and its perfect for her. There hasn\\'t been any issue with the games and educational apps she uses. I was in the middle of moving and didnt want to get a new labtop and found this Amazon Fire for a good price. Ive been very happy with it. If your looking for a cheap easy to use tablet look no further. This is a very good product my kids do homework on it Bought this for our 6 year old daughter and she uses it daily. She enjoys watching movies on it and playing learning games. So far it has been very durable and battery life has been great. Bought this for my husband at Christmas. He is VERY happy with it and It keeps him out of my hair. Bought one for our young son too. Now i can breathe. LOL. We\\'ve had no issues with them and has more than met our expectations. Well worth the money & a VERY good deal! Nice tablet, great price for the product makes a good gift for someone. My son wanted a tablet just for his books. We looked at e-readers and tablets, this was so much better and the price was perfect. I\\'m used to a n iPad so I wasnt impressed with the kindle. I found it hard to navigate the fire hd is great for reading kindle books . Its pretty slow for surfing the web. If your looking for a great kindle this is it. I would not recommend this for surfing the web. Bought this kindle for my dad for Christmas. He loves it. Best budget tablet out there. Hasn\\'t everything you need for someone who uses a tablet here and there. The only regret I have is that the price went down the week after I purchased it. It is much easier to use than a phone because of it\\'s screen size and it\\'s capabilities. This tablet is replacing an older model and the updates are wonderful. I can handle most media on this tablet and the resolution is great. I like the change of the camera to the back of the kindle instead of the front screen; now I can see what I\\'m aiming at! Easy to use and can\\'t beat the price. Love the kindle and the price was excellent. I would recommend it. Bought 2 of these tablets for my kids. They love them and easy to use. Bought this for my son and he absolutely loves it! I chose this one because of the price and size of screen to use as an ereader. It has not disappointed. Got this for the kids for Xmas...was the BEST gift. This is a great tablet for anyone easy to use!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Amazon Fire HD 8 Tablet: With a vivid 8 touch screen and access to Amazon Underground, this tablet makes it easy to watch movies, play games or catch up on your reading with personalized recommendations. Cloud storage offers simple access to your content from anywhere. Great entry level tablet/reader holds a lot and it\\'s expandable of 128 GB With the Amazon fire tablet you get everything you would expect in a high-end tablet for less than $100. That\\'s hard to beat! Love this tablet daughter uses it mainly and she really likes it good for reading and games as well as web surfing meets all needs ! Our 11 year old daughter received this for Christmas and she seems to love it so fay. Does just enough to keep her entertained and I love the fact that she can easily access her books when she wants. I loved this tablet. I did! BUT I did not love that I was being sold ads every time I powered up! I loathe even more that I would have had to pay $15 to discontinue that feature. Amazon if you want $105 dollars for the Kindle Fire, charge it! but don\\'t under price the device, and then flash ads at the the consumer at every opportunity. It is unbecoming of you! I returned this item pronto! This isn\\'t a high end tablet. Don\\'t buy it if your goal is to play the latest high octane tablet games. But for general use, for most people - web surfing, light games like Angry Birds and those match the fruit games, casting movies to a television - it\\'s an amazing value. The Amazon geared operating system isn\\'t a problem. It took a few minutes to get the Google world onto the tablet. - Google Play, Google Store, Google this and that. The 7\" version is an even better deal, but my mom needed this slightly larger screen. She loves it! Bought this for my father in law who is not tech savvy. The free \"May Day\" feature is the best part- I don\\'t get called for tech support all of the time. I\\'ve had this tablet for a few months now and i like it. The picture is excellent, the sound from the speakers is more than sufficient and the wifi is quick. bought this for my father, who never did much on computers and was not sure he would actually use this. He unwrapped it, asked for some games to be downloaded and hasn\\'t looked back! He has used the internet as well as the game apps and couldn\\'t be happier. Got this when they were on sale last year and love it!I use it primarily to read and get emails with some surfing. It has worked flawlessly for these applications. Nice tab and worth for its money..got this from best buy during thanks giving and gifted to my friend... Hard to use, No way to delete things from screen. Need better manual. most books are impossible if they are reference books. Bought for our son so he wouldn\\'t have to carry books back from his deployment Sweet tablet yo, does good work for my grandma and super easy I bought this tablet on Black Friday, when it was on special for my little girl. I wasn\\'t expecting much from the tablet... boy was I surprised by its capabilities! Love the tablet! Bought for my 9 years Granddaughter, she loves it. I love my new Kindle. Use it everyday. It is easy to use and understand I chose this a tablet. Very easy to use and navigate. My 6 and 4 year old grandsons can use them with ease. Some apps are limited as you do not have Google Play, but there is plenty of games and learning games available. Got this for my 10 year old grandson. He really likes it a lot. This is good for kids to learn responsibility using tablets. This was an item I bought for black Friday because the price was really low. I love it. It gets the job done, great travel item. $49.99, is exactly how much it\\'s worth. The sound is low, but again for a good inexpensive, travel tablet, this is a Best Buy:) Long battery life, good screen, reasonably fast.gaming. Got it for my 9 year old son for his Common robot, he loves it, it\\'s very easy to use and for the price well worth it I bought 2 one for each one of my daughters and they both like them. Got this kindle as a Christmas present for my mother and she absolutely loved it. She enjoys reading at night but hates how dim the lights are when she reads a book. This was a perfect compromise! This is a very good tablet for the price, especially for Amazon Prime members. The display is very sharp and so far the battery life is excellent! Great starter tablet without the big cost. Does everything I need. Got this for my wife for Christmas, wasn\\'t sure she would use it. Turned out to be a great gift. Perfect for email, facebook with the Kids, get\\'s her bookclub book delivered instantly from Amazon. And good battery life with a sharp picture. I bought 2 of these. I didn\\'t want to pay the price for an iPad since they were a gift for my pre-teens. Very satisfied with my purchase and the kids were able to get their gaming apps. Con: they take a while to charge, that\\'s why I\\'m giving it 4 stars. The Amazon Fire is great for our 6 year old to play some games. Brought it as a gift for my wife and she loves it! I was initially excited to get the Kindle. I am extremely disappointed with all the ads. Even more disappointed to find out that I could pay Amazon more money to remove the ads. It\\'s frustrating that Best Buy and more specifically Amazon, don\\'t let the consumer know on the box or in store advertising that what you\\'re buying is a mini advertising billboard. Why couldn\\'t there be an upfront statement on the box or in the store stating that the \"low price\" is subsidized by all the ads on the device? Would this have changed my purchase? Absolutely!!!! I would have spent a couple bucks more and probably got a Samsung tablet. Kindle Fire HD8 is an upgrade for me from Kindle Fire 7. It has many more features and is very easy to navigate. Can\\'t beat the quality and performance of this tablet for $60. I bought it to be my main link with my Amazon Prime. But used it last week instead to download Direct TV app so I could use it to watch the FBS championship game. It worked great but it couldn\\'t help my bama team win. Just what my Niece wanted for Christmas! She is enjoying every minutes use ! Bought for my Grandson for Christmas. He loves it. Glad I went with the 16GB,Thanks to the advice of BEST Buy employee. I got this for reading books, I still like ipad better though. Purchased this for our 8yo--she loves it! Had to return the 1st one after just.a few days as the screen would go black after typing in password--periodically. However, Best Buy traded it out for a new one! BOUGHT THIS FOR MY FATHER AS HE HAD MY OLD KINDLE EASY FOR HIM TO USE This is my 4th Kindle - I use it as a tablet when I travel Overall this is a great product. It sometimes freezes with some of the games but other apps work great. Alexa is a great addition. So many apps to look at hard to put down when everythig can be reached at your figertips Great tablet, sturdy, excellent screen quality. Amazon has done a fantastic job of making their tablets user friendly. Excellent for reading books or playing games. Would highly recommend. The screen is great on the Fire HD 8. This tablet was given to a child and she loves the tablet. The only thing I don\\'t like about the whole Amazon experience is the advertisement. Other than that, the tablet is nice. The headphone jack restarts the tablet when you plug the headphone cord into it. That is why I am giving the product only 2 stars. Otherwise, the screen is great. Simple and objective this tablet is an excellent choice for adults and children. This is an intermediate size tablet that works very well for its designed purpose. The price was good and it has plenty of acc. Love this one.It is my third kindle.My last one was a bit larger but it was a bit heavy.Love this one for reading or playing games.I can check my email and shop on line as well as take and store photos.I can also listen to music. Good tablet. A lot of tablet for the money. Great for kids Amazon continues to offer quality products with the Amazon fire HD 8 for a reasonable price. Good price, easy to work and the Grandkids loved . Wanted something small and this was perfect size . They just keep getting better. This is great for the beginner or pro I only use the kindle fire tablet for entertainment; music, games and eBooks. It\\'s a great basic tablet at a low price. The SD card I added allows me to save lots music and books. The tablet is rather slow in charging but once fully charged it holds up well. Upgraded from 1st generation Fire tablet. Decided to go with 16GB tablet and there were none in store so I had to order for free delivery to store. Arrived on day promised. Was easy to sync new tablet with older tablet. Very nice picture and video. Great value. Wife loves it so makes my life better what else do you need to know past that. The screen size is good and the HD pictures are clear. I also like the camera photos. They are better than my cell phone camera. The size of the pictures are great. I would recommend this Fire HD for the ease of use. The built quality is great taking into considerarions its price. The tablet is pretty fast and responsive. However, Amazon\\'s operating system is horrible. I miss a lot of apps that I use in my Apple devices, and some others that just don\\'t work as good such as Mint and Netflix (don\\'t have download capability). Also it won\\'t work with my Chromecast devices... I bought this for my wife and she absolutely loves this device . I have an older kindle and wanted more space. This works very well The amazon fire hd8 is awesome! Easy to navigate, color is beautiful A great tablet for not a lot of money. Does what the more expensive tablets does for less. Got it last black Friday. Was looking for a cheap decent tab. Could\\'ve been better if there was a mirroring capability. Was looking at some more expensive Android tablets to replace a 3-year old device and saw this one on sale. Despite the relatively much lower price, I was originally very worried that the Amazon app ecosystem was going to be sorely lacking compared to the full Google Play catalog. But it turns out that while it is missing some important apps (not just games but productivity apps too), the more than adequate specs (good enough screen, 1.5 GB of RAM, decent processor) are enough for 95% of what I need from a tablet. And if you can get it on sale, you can\\'t go wrong. Lastly, if you\\'re deciding between the 7\" and this 8\" Fire, splurge a little bit and get this one instead. Amazon Fire HD8 is great for browsing and reading. GPS system not that great though. I was not told I had to belong to Amazon. Could not get it to work with my Router. I had been wanting this Tablet for some time and finally decided to purchase it. I am heart sick to have to return it. At one time working with the a general Manager by the name of Brenda on my problems, she was highly disrespectful , embarrassing to me I front of other customers and very rude. Representing Best Buy to the people who actually pay her salary and taking all into account, I would fire her in a heart beat. I understand from other employees she is like this quite often. If you can\\'t fire her maybe taking her off the floor where she has to deal with the public and putting her behind the scenes would benefit Best Buy more than you know. 01-16-2017. Thank you. This is the best thing for reading specially on the go. Now I want one. My older son wants one to. Keep of the good work. It\\'s good budget tablet for someone who wants to use light apps, video streaming, and internet.1.5gb ram is enough for most apps.16g memory and sd card slot gives enough space. This is my second amazon fire purchase. I wanted one for home and one to keep with me for traveling and work. It\\'s was to negotiate and fits all my basic daily needs. Bought this tablet cause it was super cheap during December. It\\'s a good tablet for someone who doesn\\'t need a powerhouse This is a good tablet for basic use. I ened up returning it and going with an iPad which met my needs more. This tablet would be good for someone with limited computer knowledge/use. Purchased this as a Christmas gift for an adopted family. The teenager absolutely loved it! Awesome tablet! Super quick, great picture, and overall great quality This was bought as a replacement for my wife\\'s previous kindle. She is loving the larger screen and the fact that it has a camera. Nice tablet, gives different choices for readers. Easy to use. Bought the tablet on Black Friday to replace a 4 year old Nexus 7. Liked it so much that I purchased another a week later at full price. Bright clear screen, good battery life, expandable memory, fast and easy to use. No complaints. Bought it for myself. It is everything its advertised to be. Works great; especially if you are a Amazon Prime member. This product met my needs perfectly. It was easy to set up and portable to use anywhere. I bought this tablet during black friday for 60 dollars and it is well worth the price. Definitely an upgrade from the first gen tablet. This watch is not only very useful, it\\'s very cute and comfortable. I love the fitness aspects-it motivates me to be more active. I also enjoy the \"smartwatch\" abilities. I can read my text messages without anyone knowing it! Also, the battery last a few days at the very least. Best Buy has a good price structure for the Kindle Staff members were very helpful Had a paperwhite for years...The fire is my go to for news, new shows, and reading. Good book prices, credible news. Loving it. Paying $49 for a decent screen size to support portable surfing and email on wifi is a great deal. Not sure I\\'m a fan of Silk, but it works well enough. The Amazon Fire HD is easy to use. The 8\" tablet is just the right size. Sharp screen that\\'s not too big or small. Takes some getting used to if you normally use an IPhone. Be prepared for ads, which must be the reason they can sell it at such a low price. Slim profile, just heavy enough to feel substantial and high quality. Hard to find cases at physical stores. My friend is enjoying getting acquainted with her first ever electronic device. It is just what she needed to get into the digital age. She is an older woman and is excited about all she can do on her Kindlefire. I was not sure what to expect from this little tablet at such a low price but I am impressed! The 8 inch version is a good size and a lot easier to carry around than my heavier 10 inch tablet. I read negative reviews about the video quality but I have not had any issues and use it to watch Netflix regularly with very clear and uninterrupted quality. The amazon App Store is definitely limited but with an android based system, it is very easy to install the google play store without having to root your device and voiding the warranty. This was a gift for my wife and she has truly enjoyed it. The different lighting for reading so helpful. Very user friendly. For the price best deal out there. Bought it for my wife who reads a lot of books. She loves it!! This is a very solid device for under $100. The screen quality is great, and performance is hard to beat for most typical use. I needed more power to run some very intense apps, like Litchi for controlling a DJI Mavic. So if you are looking for a Powerhouse you should look for something with a bit more processor and atleast 3Gb Ram. Amazon is great tablet and the price is excellent great Have a 7\", wanted a bigger screen. This is perfect and price was great. User friendly and overall great product. Camera quality is not the greatest but this is not intended to be used as a camera so I can\\'t complain. Love this tablet easy to use and extremely affordable If you\\'re main purpose is shows, books, light web browsing/social media, and light gaming -- this is the perfect tablet. Very friendly price. Nice construction. Bought as a reading tool for my daughter. She enjoys it and also the fact that she can download apps. Great tool for school and fun Bought for husband to replace his old one. Uses it all the time and would recommend. daughter loves it uses it every day likes everything about it. My youngest daughter is very pleased with this tablet. Easy to use. Perfect for using for my clinicals in nursing school Great tablet for the price, it was a Christmas present and so far so good! Easy to use and the HD is awesome. The simplicity as well as the easy to follow directions to set it up is great. It does everything I want it to do. Great products as usual and great customer service Very functional for a tablet and e-reader. This was a purchase for my stepmom who broke her previous Kindle. She likes it because the screen is big, ease of use, and you can access the internet. The kids side is good too for the kids but some of the apps like YouTube and YouTube Kids will not play on this because it\\'s an Amazon operating system. Overall I would recommend this to people who like the regular e-readers and want a tablet. It helps if your an amazon prime member . You can download a lot more things to do on the tablet This was purchased as a gift for an avid reader and as a streaming media device. I looked at the bigger kindle but this one is the right compromise between size and portability for the planned uses. A great alternative to the more expensive tablets. Battery lasts for quite a while. Love love love my kindle fire. Had the original and then bought and iPad then bought this kindle and I am wondering why I even bought the iPad. Will not switch again. I will stick with my kindle. The fire runs well and was easy to set up. The pop up adds are a bit annoying but the tablet works well. Happy with the purcase. Gift for my mother in law. ok i did like the product very much thank you for ok I recommend this tablet !!! I like it a lot , perfect size and perfect price Great for reading books. Does everything an iPad or tablet does. Bought for Xmass for my wife. She is not electronic competent, but found is easy to use. Tends to flip out of my screen to something else. Each screen change = at least one pop up ad. Otherwise, it\\'s been reliable so far. It is a lot cheaper than other tablets with all the functions I need. This is a excellent tablet for browsing the internet and reading ebooks and for the price you can\\'t beat it.. My ND would way rather have a fire any day than an ipad! Loved the product. First I was disappointed that I could not download Google Store apps but a Quick Google Search fixed that Issue and now I can download any Google Store Apps. The Battery Life is amazing as I was able to Watch around 4 Full Movies on a Single Charge. Performance is great as Games like Marvel Champions Modern Strike Online had no issues. Able to add an SD Card is just perfect as I dont have to worry about Storage for downloading Movies or Apps. Speakers are better then my Samsung Galaxy S7. For the Price point of this Tablet there is not a single thing to Complain. If I have to Brightness of the Screen can be better. the amount i paid for the tablet is worth it on sale. Gifted this to my Mom primarily for reading books. Able to check out e-books from our local library. Works great. She also uses this for Skype, e-mails and Facebook. Her grand kids also use it - downloaded few games and play. Bought this during Black Friday sale and was an even better deal. It is a good tablet. My grandson loves it . He was very happy with it . This tablet works well for surfing the internet and playing music. My husband and I have totally enjoyed owning these Amazon Fire tablets. They are so much easier on the eyes than our iphones! My 8-year-old grandson is able to access all the games he\\'s used to, but also many new games and videos. He finds something new to do almost every time he turns it on. Great improvement over the old kindle fire. Better size than the hd7. Not to big and not too small. Fast processing spead. My wife loves it. Great picture quality and easy to use should have bought 2 at the sale price, fast, decent graphics great for reading ebooks best of fits in wife\\'s purse If you are looking for an inexpensive tablet just for basic web surfing/shopping/etc., I don\\'t know that you can get a better deal. However, that is about all you can do. We found out the hard way that the Fire (which we bought to replace a misplaced iPad, so maybe we were just spoiled) is pretty limited in terms of the Apps you can download. Forget about any Google based Apps and many of the standard apps that are generally available in the Android or Apple market place. I love Amazon itself and don\\'t have any major issues with the product I got for the price I paid, I just won\\'t be going the cheap route in the future. Hindsight being 20/20, I should have spent the money to just get a new iPad since that is what we were used to. Got this for my 10 year old son. Great for reading books and playing games. Can\\'t beat the price. Bought for my wife.. she loves it.. took some getting use to though but she is doing well with it I have a couple of iPads and decided to get this for general browsing, movie watching etc. Very pleased with the overall package. An added bonus is the very nice Amazon integration. Bought as a gift for my mother. Instead of her feeling locked at the computer she can now access the web from anywhere in the house. This is just the perfect item for what we needed. It is compact and can go anywhere with you. She says this was the best gift she ever received. My kids got this to replace their Ipads and haven\\'t missed a beat. Love the new Fire - great for books, games, and getting online! Easy to use features and perfect size screen to take on the go! Bought this for my aunt for Christmas. She had wanted a book reader. But then she decided she wanted something she could \"play games on.\" She\\'s very happy with it! Never owned a tablet before, but am loving it so far. great tablet, simple to use, just love it.compatible with other amazon products. I bought this for my Mother because her Nook wasn\\'t working any more. Although it took her a little while to adjust to the new device, she really enjoys it! I wanted a tablet that was a decent screen size, that could play games, that could stream movies (Netflix, Prime), that could check e-mails, that could Skype, etc. all while remaining affordable (under $100). I have yet to see a tablet in this price range that can do all these things effortlessly, while remaining this affordable. This tablet has handled whatever I throw at it, and with no hiccups. I had the cheaper $50 Fire tablet prior to this one, and that thing was slow to process the most basic tasks. If you\\'re looking for an affordable tablet that can do what a more expensive tablet can do, then pick this one up. Purchased as a replacement for an older kindle and the fire HD did not disappoint. The intended recipient was thrilled that a camera came with it. Well worth the money. 4th amazon product I own it is a great budget tablet. Bought for the daughter for Christmas and seems to work great Bought this for my wife for Christmas (a perfect gift, if I do say so myself), and seeing the joy that it brings her on a near daily basis makes me want one for myself. Alas, it will be another six years in the sequin mines outside Nashville until I can save enough to get another one. But someday... I purchased this during the black friday sale. I\\'m happy with the overall product with the exception of two things.1.) the auto brightness control is not good enough for me, its either too bright or too dark. I can\\'t figure out if I\\'m having issue with the colors or something else.2.) the 2nd issue is not with the tablet itself but after using this for a while i\\'ve realized using 8\" tablets for watching movies is not a good experience. For the price this tablet is an absolute steal! I\\'ve never had an iPad to compare it to but that\\'s only because I\\'ve never wanted to spend hundreds of dollars for a tablet. Recently upgraded from the 7inch kindle and i must say huge improvements. all i can say is that if they can speed up the processor by next year with more ram they might compete with the ipad! The tablet was a good gift for Christmas. I bought it on black Friday for a cheap price For my 3-year-old, it serves it purpose and very cost effective. I put a memory card in this and put the Play Store on it (Google it). I use it as a mini office with a Bluetooth keyboard. I love it. This 8\" tablet is much better than the older 7\" tablet. It is faster and have a camera. Great improvement over the older version. This is an awesome tablet, fast, great HD display and has all the apps I need for personal entertainment. If you look for a great tablet for entertainment, surfing the net, or reading your e-mail, this is the best you can have. I also purchased a 128 GB SanDisk Ultra Plus memory card. I strongly recommend it, not for work but it’s great for entertainment. Great size. Works with all apps. No issues yet. Would buy more. bought this for my son(12), and he loves it. Constantly on it. Got a great price during the holidays. Completely satisfied. This Amazon Fire is perfect for what I need - nice screen and memory size, really nice apps preinstalled and it\\'s just ready to use! The Black Friday price was beyond wonderful!!!!! Gifts for 4 yr old grandsons very easy for them to maneuver around.. great charge life. We have to force.them to take breaks. I bought this tablet for myself for Christmas! I\\'ve enjoyed the ease of use and the price I paid was great. In fact, I purchased another for my son for Christmas. This is the perfect tablet for basic use or if upgrading from the kids edition of the Amazon Fire. Much less expensive than an iPad and more durable if you have a tween who isn\\'t always careful with their tech. This was the first time I had a tablet. It is so much fun to play games on! Prefer no amps on unit and just allow buyer to place the amps they want or will ever use. Had to chose between Fire 10 and Fire 8. For the money, you can\\'t go wrong with the Fire 8. Screen is good for \" older eyes\". I have been holding off buying one of these for years, but on black friday the price was an astonishing $49. The amount of tablet you get for that amount of money is unrivaled. It is a great investment if you enjoy books or media. Great for kids, my kids haven\\'t stopped playing with it This is perfect for kids. The parental controls make me feel secure in letting my child use the tablet safely. I would recommend this to other grandparents for their grandkids this works great if you use amazon a lot and watch movies from amazon Great product for surfing the internet or reading books! I am familiarizing my self with no conclusion to say something about it now. I was expecting an Android device and discovered it was an \"Android like\" device. My fault for not reading up on his device before hand. I returned the Amazon Fire and bought a Samsung Tab E.I probably would recommend this tablet if you wanted a device for reading. Bought this as a gift for my aunt and she loves it. Easy to get connected and set up. She is totally non-techny and was able to do it herself. Great buy! I was surprised by the quality of the screen, and it is no slouch either. I love this Kindle and bought it for the upgrades to replace my original kindle fire. I would give it an excellent rating if the camera were better but the pictures come out grainy and not very clear. Great for watching shows and videos and these are very clear.. Love playing games on it and of course reading the latest books. Was looking for an inexpensive tablet for our child. Got this while on sale and ordered a screen protector and child case. Has worked well. Can set daily limits to prevent them from using to much. Would buy again. If adding more than one child to the account, the screen will not rotate properly for the second, third, or fourth child. Geek squad could not fix this problem, seems to be a manufacturer\\'s issue. Also, there are too many adds. I returned this product. I brought Fire HD8 for my Daughter, She have been used it since Christmas. Bought it on sale for Christmas gift and we\\'ll worth the money. Does everything needed with good functionality. Easy to use for those not too tech savvy. Bought this as a gift - they seemed to like it. The price was nice and so was the size of it. This tablet is more often used than my ipad, the free games from amazon underground is cool with amazon prime and if you like to read it has plenty of book options and integrations with digital purchases! This is a great device. I needed something small to read books on. This device is exactly what I was looking for. Purchase this tablet during the Christmas holidays on sale. Got as a gift for my job\\'s Christmas gift party. The person who got it was very happy with it. I am familiar with the tablet because I bought one for my wife when they first came out for her to use to read her books. Good tablet for book reading and audio books, many good apps to chose from. Very good for picking up e-mail when traveling. I\\'m still finding more ways to use it. Only had it about a month. My nephew likes the \\'large\\' size of the Fire tablet as it\\'s significantly larger than his phone. This is a great little tablet especially for the price. The new tablet is great ！ nice upgrades！Love how easy it is to use. Easy to get apps, shop and browse the web. Nice deals on the product with saving and good customet experience. I bought the Kindle Fire HD as a Christmas gift for my mom. She has never had a computer or Kindle. She loves it. Best gift I gave her. She plays a lot of games on it. That keeps her mind working. Love the size of screen. Purchased for my nephew for Christmas. He loved it and really enjoy it for playing games and reading books. Purchased this for my nephew. He loved it and can\\'t stop playing with it. I bought this as a light-weight alternative to an iPad for collecting and enjoying Kindle and Amazon Video products. When combined with the dedicated Fire cover, it\\'s low price along with a very readable screen and the option for a Micro SD card make it an excellent choice for travel and time spent in waiting-rooms, etc., allowing lots of memory space for ones library as well as flexibility regarding how it is held or positioned. My grandson broke his Amazon fire table one day after warranty expired. He was disappointed. So I bought him an 8 version . He had a big smile. This serves every function I need in a tablet. Price is right. It\\'s a handy little tool to have for reading e-Books. Bought this as a gift but was wrong item wanted so wasn\\'t used Easy to use, fast, sleek and battery holds good charge , happy with it Very easy to use and navigate. Perfect size to carry in my purse and still a good sized screen to watch movies. This product is very user friendly and it is very lightweight this was great buy & can do it all.fair price & great games Most of the time I use the tablet for the Web, reading and email, but when I want to work on a Word doc, pdf, budget and a lot more, I can do it well on the tablet without pulling out my laptop. The screen isn\\'t as sharp as the S2 models but is nice enough and it does not lack anything else. This was bought primarily for photos. I added the 128 card. Putting in the 128 card might have been a little tricky but the sales rep did it for me. My wildlife photos look brilliant on the tablet. I\\'d recommend making a Geek Squad appt for about an hour after you plan to buy the tablet. That way you learn how to use it before leaving the store. Also I got one that had been returned but all the parts still had the plastic wrap on them. That made it $100 less and hence the \"great deal\" in the title. It may pay to ask about a return. I plan to take some of the free classes offered. It was well worth the Black Friday price! The screen is so clear, it is easy to handle especially for people with not so big hands, easy and fast when navigating. I liked the volume buttons on the side of my old 7\" Fire better than on top like this new 8\". That\\'s the only reason I didn\\'t give it a 5 star rating. i just adore my fire 8...the features, size of screen, easy log in and graphics This is an awesome tablet. it is fast with great pictures! Price was right, great tablet for playing games and reading I got this tablet for Black Friday at a decent price. It\\'s 8 inches, you can add more space with a micro sd and very easy to use. Tablet works great. Nice big size good battery power. No problems using it. I am still learning all the different things I can do with the Kindle Fire. So far I like it. Perfect product for senior citizen who just wants to do a little internet shopping and receive and send emails. Nice size screen and easy to use. Great gift for a lot less investment than an ipad or laptop. Great buy for the money, no complaints. Highly recommended. I bought this as a gift and the recipient loves the processing speed and the fact that it has 2 cameras on the device. I am very happy with the kindle fire hd 8. it is very easy to use. I bought this for my mother for Christmas. She is not the most technological advanced individual. She really wanted a tablet and this one works great and is super easy to use. I went to program it for her and she insisted on doing it herself. She was able to no problem! Easy to use tablet. Price is pretty good. My mom loves it. Bought this tablet for a relative for Christmas who wanted access to audiobooks. My only issue is that the tablet needs a wifi connection in order for the audio to work with certain apps. Not a problem if you have constant access to wifi but my relative does not. Nice tablet otherwise. This device completely meets my needs for reading and accessibility. Works good, has very nice screen brightness and resolution I bought this tablet for my 9 year old. Easy to use and awesome graphics. Easy for adults to manage apps and parental controls. When my husband and I bought our Kindle Fire 8, we went to Best Buy and asked questions as best we could. There are programs we apparently need to put create and edit documents and spreadsheets!! We did ask if it had those features and was told yes but I think we need to have a special app. Why isn\\'t there a manual or step by step guide on getting the most use out of Kindle Fire 8. Can I get it online? Kindle Fire 8 fun to use but needs more info for customers. Can we go to a class at Best Buy? Thanks for any help. Great tablet for the price point....especially if you are big Amazon user.Expandable memory is a great feature. The kids more expensive tablets died twice. Repair was more than the Fire brand new. I would buy another one for the priceGood product My teenager loves to read and we purchased it for her. Great purchase! Would give 5 stars but THE ADDS!!!!!! Just as functional as my iPad Replaced Kobo EReader with this tablet, very satisfied with performance and price. Upgraded from a standard kindle to a kindle fire. Lots more features and about the same price.. I would definitely recommend this for anyone who wants a tablet but doesn\\'t want to pay a lot of money.. This was a great Christmas gift for my kid. This allows them to store their favorite books and play some educational games. Its nice to also have an optional MicroSD card for extra storage. works great for reading or playing games it connects to the web fast and responds very well I got this on black Friday for my mother and so far she enjoys it. It was to replace her iPad mini 1 that they have basically designed to become in operable within 2 years. She can add storage to the Kindle, the picture is fire, and she can read a plethora of books that suit her fancy. It\\'s nice size and responsive. Perfect for face timing with family. Perfect for travel. Convenient and way to use. First tablet for me. Very happy. Bought two tablets for the kiddos. Overall, price was great and works well. Only issue is download speed. Tends to take a while to download apps and other stuff. I love this! I use it daily! And I love the fact that I can add a ad card for more memory! Love it and would recommend it for the young as the old Kids got the kindle fire for Christmas, pretty happy with it. Purchased on black Friday deal for $59.99. Good buy! Not iPad quality but a fraction of the price and nice for watching prime videos and normal apps. Would purchase at standard price also as a fun extra tablet. Bought this tablet for my wife and she likes it. She plays a few games, checks her email, and goes on Facebook. High end users would not be satisfied with this tablet but overall an excellent value. Unable to download the Instagram app. which stinks I had an Apple Mini Ipad that was an older version and ran very slow due to older version OS I was told. I bought the Fire to replace it since I mostly use it for gaming through my WIFI. It was way cheaper and does everything I wanted and is very fast. No issues waiting for uploads. It has all the other features as well like weather, camera , and I have started to use Alexa and that is great. Nice size screen. Very fast easy to use nice size nice screen I bought this for my husband who is in a nursing home to be able to listen to music.. He loves it... And uses it every day for music and other things too. I love my old kindle, but after a few years and drops the power button doesn\\'t like to work a lot of the time. So took advantage Black Friday deal to replace the one that is going out. Basically, the tab\\'s features are good. There are huge Amazon collections. Kids can be allowed to use it without parents monitoring as parents control feature is good. Several useful Amazon products are offered free of charge. I hope that It is worth for the money value. nice tabket for the money with many nice features and durable I love the kindal because i am a reader. i able to check out books from library through overdrive but if i get an alert about world event i simply go to ond of the news app\\'s and get the latest headline. Great price. Love this tablet! Super bright colors! Great for gamers! Can\\'t bet this tablet for any price! I love reading my books on this, and the Alexa flash briefings each morning before I go to work at top notch The kindle fire hd is a wonderful tool as well as a device for entertainment. The beauty of the kindle fire is the price. I look forward to buying updated devices. My son enjoys it no complaints works great long battery life holds a charge better than any tablet i have ever had nice size, very clear but randomly shuts off. cant remove unwanted apps from the home screen. if you watch video..it buffers alot and laggs. love it, can do alot of stuff on it, would recommend fire hd8 to everyone This is the 3rd Kindle Fire that I have purchased. This one is much faster and more user friendly. We just bought our 2 grand daughters and 2 grandsons a Kindle Fire with the youngest 8 yrs old. He has it mastered already. Great tablet for a good price. Being used to an Ipad this is difficult to adust to but does the job just fine for a low price - good size to carry around without weighing down your purse. Would buy again This is an awesome product love the flexibility it has with not only book reading but other apps as well. Received this tablet as present for young grandson. While I am not an Amazon tablet fan (don\\'t like hybrid operating system), this device meets all the requirements I had hoped for: ease of use, optional micro SD capacity, and plenty of internal memory. No technology is ever like a real book you can smell, but this little notebook in nice. It does so many things well. This is my second kindle. Love size of screen and it is super light. Great camera. We originally owned an original kindle but it was slow app store was not the best and overall interface was to be desired. In fact eventually the device crashed and couldn\\'t be recovered with limited use. Deeply debated about getting another and actually bought a Samsung tablet, but it was too small. This was such a good deal it was hard to ignore and have been very happy to give another try. This device is a great size and much better interface. Would buy again and will consider in the future for the kids. My daughter loved it nd I love that she leaves my phone alone now. We ordered one for each of our 2 boys (ages 7 and 5) as Christmas gifts. They love them. Setup took a bit of time to get the Amazon store and parental controls, but well worth the time once its was all set up. We set it all up before wrapping them so the kids could enjoy them right away. It\\'s their favorite gift this year. Easy to use and great quality. All 3 of my kids have a Kindle Fire I bought this e reader for myself and I love it. The price was great and the product is nice. I got this for myself on black Friday. I have had 2 Kindles before but never the Fire. Love it! I love the fact that is very practical and I didn\\'t have to spend a lot of money. Well my kids love them. So that\\'s great for me. The only bad thing I can say is i can\\'t figure out how to make it so they can download free games and not ones that cost money. Got this kindle on black Friday for a great price. It is a good performer at a great price. I use it as a nice versatile tablet, not just for kindle bok reading. Wow this tablet for the price of 40$ at the time what a value. Works very well, easy to use, great for beginners. I\\'m not very good with electronics, so I was worried about learning how to use my Kindle Fire. I had no problems at all with navigation of this device. I feel it\\'s also fast I was expecting it to be sluggish. I think this is great for the beginner and is a great bargain. This imy 3rd kindle device.I chose it becazuse it haf more memory/stoeage This is a great tablet plus you can\\'t beat this price. I got this tablet on Black Friday. It was a great price, and being a Prime member, it has become my favorite entertainment venue on the go. The screen\\'s not as sharp as an iPad or Samsung tablet, but for the price I got it for and its entertainment value, it can\\'t be beat. I bought my fire tablet during the Christmas sale season for a great price to replace my aging iPad. I am really impressed with the speed of downloads and the quality of the video. I added an inexpensive SD card to download videos and shows. It is great for travel. The fire hd 8 is a nice improvement over the 7\" model. First, the extra ram makes browsing noticeably smoother and the screen is crystal clear. It is not on the same level as apple ipad or samsung galaxy, but still a huge improvement over previous kindle tablets. I bought the Amazon Fire HD 8 for my husband for Christmas. He\\'s never too excited about gifts but he is using this tablet every day and even though he won\\'t admit it, he absolutely loves it. Would definitely buy again, especially during Black Friday specials. Easy to use, size is just right. Easy for my wife to travel with and carry in her purse. As a low priced 8\" tablet, it has a good display, good speed, and reasonable battery life.I am a bit peeved by the rather intrusive adds that Amazon pushes onto it.I am also unhappy that I cannot load all the apps I am used to using on my Android phone. Overall, I wish I had spent more for a real Android device rather than having this with the Amazon limited version of Android. This tablet was a gift to my daughter because she\\'s an avid reader and anime watcher. She has been nothing but excited since she opened it and there have been zero complaints. My kindle fire HD8 is quite an upgrade to my old Kindle. Camera is a terrific addition and the screen is so much better. Got an unbelievable deal!! The best part is having a library of books at my fingertips!! Easy and simple to set up and great when I\\'m traveling!! I bought this for my daughter and she loves it! Works great for YouTube, Netflix and adding a few games. Easy to learn how to use and no \"accidental\" purchases can be made if you use the option to switch user accounts. My boys love their new tablets due to the cool features, books, apps and games. I love the parental controls, processor speed, battery life and light weight. Combined with a great discount at Best Buy and you get a win, win, WIN! I was using this for a while it was 10X faster then my kindle 5th generation yes 1gb of ram but the App Store made from Amazon is not the best so I downloaded the google play store to get the apps I mostly used I only use my kindle fire had 8 for books and reading or watching YouTube or the web I\\'m giving the rating 4 stars If you are using Amazon Prime, you definitely like this table as it can stream the video, audio, reading book... easy to carry with you I\\'ve had kindles since they first came out love it Perfect for my elderly mom to play games and use for reading It is a good tablet, but is a little slow downloading apps Great for what it is. The product is solid. Got it as a gift for family. Bought as a gift for my Mom. She\\'s so happy. Therefore, I\\'m happy Excellent resolution and speed. I love the easy usability of the new fire. I got this for my sister as a gift. So far so good. The price was just right. My daughter loves her tablet....she takes it with her everywhere! I had to sideload google play services to be able to download from the google play store or use google chrome as a web browser, as this tablet was designed to be exclusive to Amazon. I used daily and its works awesome, the price and performance are good I suggested to my friends , bought last yrs as well gave to my dad, he loves it. the kindle is all way a good product for the money the hold family have one just got me the 10\\' and love it get a Kindle and same money at the same time It\\'s big then the one I had I would tell my friends I purchased this Fire Tablet as a Christmas gift for my husband. He is learning to use it and so far likes it really well. He hasn\\'t downloaded any books yet but he now has an email address and will soon have a Facebook account. His brothers & sisters live around the country so now he will be able to keep in contact with them. Purchased for my granddaughter and it was a great investment. This little $60 tablet is really good for reading ebooks and watching netflix My Hulu plays perfectly..great volume. Kindle starts right up so I\\'m able to read fine. However, when I\\'m on Facebook and click on an article to read, it goes to the page, and within 30 seconds, the page closes. Sometimes Facebook app won\\'t even load. I find it blanking in and out and not showing some icons at times. I haven\\'t dropped it so I\\'m assuming this is an internal problem :( I have tried playing a couple games and it will say that I need \"the Amazon app\" where I go to purchase stuff, which I already have...then it closes out saying ERROR. I wish I could replace for a new one. Nice size screen, clear and clean picture with plenty of storage I bought two of these kindles. One for my preteen granddaughter whom had no problem at all being up and running. However, My senior mother found that the touch screen was not sensitive enough for the menu to drop easily for her. As a first time user on the kindle fire my mom will take time getting used to it. However, my tech savvy granddaughter loves her already. This replaced my old original kindle fire. What a great upgrade. Thought it was to be better than what it is. Mother in law can play games an Facebook on it. Next time I will buy her a samsung It was on a total of an hour and a half when the screen went completely dark. Would not turn on after that. The battery was fine....It just quit working all together. Bought this for my 9 year old Godson and he loves it. He would play it for hours on end if his parents would let him. He mostly plays games on it but he also uses it to watch videos and read books. Easily added apps including Google Play store... Not rocket science. Battery life is phenomenal, great for cross country flights. The granddaughter loves it and she can\\'t put it down. We bought this to replace a Kindle Fire pad and they have come a long way in this build, I would recommend this or if you like a bigger one then get then10\" version. Great build qualityGood screen resolution for the moneyCan install android applications -including kodi Like this so much bought another one for my daughter. My husband and I were looking around for a tablet for our daughter. We wanted something that she could use easily and we wouldn\\'t have to worry about what she was doing. With the different profiles and parental controls available we have enjoyed our choice of this tablet. Bought this for our granddaughter. She absolutely loves it! Easy for her to learn how to operate. First of all, this is not an iPad or a more expensive android tablet, but it\\'s a very good tablet for the money. I own an iPad Pro and iPad Air 2, yet this tablet has a place in my home. If you\\'re buying for kids, I wouldn\\'t buy anything more expensive than this. Good screen, fast enough, and amazon\\'s underground free apps are a huge plus. I bought this on super sale as an e-reader and to use to browse the web in lieu of a laptop when traveling. I found it to be a great value for the price. It processes rapidly on the web through its Amazon Silk browser. Streaming music also works well. The screen has nice resolution. It does not play well with other operating system apps and the apps available through Amazon does not compare to Google. I was unable to download a Google play app, although G mail works like a champ. The camera does not produce decent images. I wouldn\\'t bother with that function. All in all a terrific buy for the money, but don\\'t expect an iPad. Good tablet but not as smooth as high end tablets. It\\'s limited to Amazon so don\\'t expect to do as much as an Android or iPad. I like mine and will continue to use it. I recommend using one if you can before buying. I love it.....................!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! The Unit works exactly as described. A very good buy. Great tablet for price. Display is clear. Enjoy books on tablet. It\\'s unfair for me to rate this product cause I have not even taken it out of the box to set it up. Kids love it. Easy setup was ready with in minutes Working Product at the price that was advertised! Great! It\\'s nice really nice. Go buy one for your grandma. She will give you a real big hug. Easy to load, works with our local library (borrow books for free). I have been using this for a bit now. It\\'s wonderful. I also have another tablet but use the kindle exclusively for reading. The kindle works extremely. If you use amazon prime this is a no brainer. Great speed and function for a small price. Does what I needed. I would recommend to others great playing games reading surfing the Internet.Camera works very good and easy upload photos when needed. This tablet works as expected. I would recommend this tablet to anyone who needs a new tablet with great battery life. Very good tablet my child enjoys it very much, the battery life is very good although he takes it for his games Delivers as advertised. Very fast performance and the kids love it Absolutely love the tablet. My wife loves it. Much more enjoyable than playing on the phone. Not an iPad, but that\\'s not what I wanted. High quality, does everything I need it to do. Great purchase. Would definitely recommend it to anyone. Not very user friendly and intuitive.Very limited capabilities and apps.Good for viewing movies.Very limited language capabilities other than English and a few other languages.Apps are downloaded, but can\\'t be found. Now all 5 of my children have a kindle. This one is by far the best one. Currently setting everything up on it but so far so good. Very good price good item. Would purchase again. This was a gift I\\'ve had my Fire HD 8 2015 for about a year and have been very satisfied with it. My wife has been using an older Fire 7 (non-HD) and I thought it was time for an upgrade for her so I decided to buy her this new Fire HD 8 for Christmas. I also installed a sceen protector, a new case and a 64GB SD card before wrapping it.She was very surprised and pleased and she noticed the big difference in speed, sound and picture quality immediately. I\\'m very happy she likes it so much. Thanks Amazon for the great product and Best Buy for the great price. Very satisfied with my tablet ,it is very easy to operate. Purchased 2 of these and am real satisfied with them!! This actually was a Christmas present for my Mother, but I had to set it up. This is a nice upgrade from her Kindle purchased three years ago. Kindle was great assisting getting it registered since neither of us could remember her password. Great picture, just the right size and has the blue dimmer Met and exceeded all expectations! Easy to use, perfect size, arrived when expected and an excellent value. Not many apps. The first one was already returned...no power issue after 1week..I hope the second one is fine... awesome tablet. wonderful upgrade from the first kindle fire We are a Kindle family! Use them all the time! Reading books, checking email, watching Netflix. Would be very sad without it!!! For the money this tablet has a great display and allows you to do pretty much the same that lots of other more expensive devices are capable of. Bought this for my daughter for Christmas. She absolutely loves it! She has been on it since she opened it. Grandkids each got one and they love it. Step up from original Kindle. I recieved this as a present for my birthday, so far it has been great. I have bought several books and it makes a great Ebook reader. This is a great tablet for the price I paid. My husband loves it! Great tablet! My son really likes it to read and also to play games! Great buy for my 7yr old cheap so if it ends up broken for any reason I can replace it easily. Purchased for a family member. They love it. Would Recommend. I was always an IPad person but after having this I\\'m fine with it. It\\'s easy to use and inexpensive. Was happy to get the toy for my son for Christmas and they won\\'t stop playing it Purchased for mother in law as a Christmas gift and she loves it. She had a version 1 and she loved. She loves the better sound, picture and speed of the newer version. Bought for my daughter she loves it. Great investment for her watching movies!! Got this on sale for 69, decent display but you can tell it is not on par with other tablets. It is great if you have prime and use their services. Great speakes, makes a huge difference in Audio quality. Battert life is good, no complaints. I gave it 4 stars due to the play store access. There is a way around it, I do have it on here now but it took some work. Purchased two Fire8 tablets for my children. My son loves it for reading books from library and my daughter loves listening to audio books.They both were not sure they would like the tablet but they really love them. Love the HD8 the extra inch makes a huge difference over the HD7. I bought this on line as a gift. The unit does not stay on and I cannot get in touch with anyone to get the unit repaired This is a great device, and free\\'s up my phone. Great for internet, games, radio, etc. Simple to use. Great for Dad who wants to play games and check weather Product worked as described. No issues with performance, and it was a simple setup! Perfect for web browsing and videos. I love my tablet. It is super easy and loads fast. Bought this for a new tablet user. After a quick training session she caught right on. Perfect size for me. Speaker clarity is amazing and produces a great picture This is a great tablet without the steep cost of an iPad. I haven\\'t used it too much so far but the picture and sound is pretty good and being able to stream movies/shows is quite nice. I bought this fire for my 7 year old and she loves it. This is the first tablet i have owned and i must say it runs great. And the battery lasts for a good amount of time. Cant complain when it comes that cheap. The battery charge life is extended and everything else is fine. Great little tablet. Inexpensive so easy for taking with you without worry. This is a great value product and is (for me) an equal to an ipad. great tab in low price and worth to spend. It has everything what i am looking for. This kindle is very convenient and has a great display that\\'s easy on the eyes. I enjoy my kindle fire had it is easy to use get it I really like the bigger screen. These are great for traveling with children Hadn\\'t really checked into Kindles/tablets before. Does more than I expected it too, tho now I\\'m a little disappointed that it\\'s a little limited to Amazon-related and approved stuff. The app store for the device is more limited even tho it uses a form of Android (which means no Flash also). But I\\'m mostly using it for reading, so I\\'m happy with it and would recommend it. The 8 was the perfect size for me, the 6 screen was too small for reading comfortably and the 10 was too big as a handheld. This was an upgrade purchase. My previous Kindle was 4 years old. (still working!) This new version is so much faster and has a much better quality camera! Love it for reading, Netflix and on-line shopping! I don\\'t know why it takes long to come on and it goes off on me my kids have no problem Overall I am happy with my Amazon Fire 8 HD. It was easy to take and use on a recent trip, although the Delta app doesn\\'t work with it so that was a little frustrating. Not crazy about seeing the ads that pop up, but for a purchase price of $65 (sale), it\\'s hard to complain. This is my first tablet and I find it to be the perfect size and easy to use. I would recommend it to anyone who wants to buy a tablet and expects to use it for reading, surfing the web, playing games and as a lightweight device travel option. I am very happy with the look of the games and everything on the screen, I can see myself using it more at home now, although I will still use my laptop when I want a bigger screen. I bought it in the store & they were out of cases, so I recommend buying a case that also acts as a stand. I found one on Amazon that was inexpensive and came in an array of colors. Purchased this as a child\\'s tablet and I couldn\\'t be happier! I was buying it thinking that it would be cut-rate but ok for a small child to play with on long car rides and on rainy days. Despite the low cost and unimpressive stats I have been very surprised by the quality. The screen is perfectly adequate for games and kids shows, the parental controls/child profile settings are excellent and the stereo speakers CRUSH the built in speakers on my iPad Air 2. The only drawbacks I have found so far are power related. The battery seems to drain fairly quickly under what I would consider normal use and the included charger (typical usb type) takes a very very long time to fully charge the tablet. I suspect this is the charger\\'s limitation rather than the tablet\\'s and it may charge better with a different power supply.I wish that I had purchased two of these tablets at the price they were for sale and I would have kept the second for my own use when on the road. Gave this to my sister-in-law for Mother\\'s Day. Its a great entry level tablet. She loves using it, especially for games. I got this tablet for my dad after his old tablet bit the dust. He loves it! Great tablet and features! One of the fastest tablets I ever had. Netflix and Hulu works awesomely! I have the 2015 generation fire and it never worked all that great as far as speed but I enjoyed the feel and the visuals of it. I just purchased the 2016 version and it is remarkably faster than the previous model. Though the newer model doesn\\'t have as nice of a feel and the visuals are not as good. The newer version was much cheaper in price so it explains the feel and visuals. I hope someday they get a model that looks and feels great and is also quick. This is my third kindle fire. It is lightweight and unobtrusive. I use it mostly for reading however I have had no issues using it for web browsing or for playing games. Overall a good little tablet for the price. This was a Mother\\'s Day gift from my son. I had wanted one for awile. It has surpass my expectations. I love it. Perfect if you\\'re looking for the basic necessities of a laptop. Only negatives no yahoo apps, no google apps, no apple app, but it\\'s still awesome. I love my Amazon fire. I purchased one for my 17 year ol and she uses it to view Netflix,Hulu and you tube. I shop,email, surf the net and pay bills with mine:-)I bought an extra and downloaded my fire1. Now I have a fire 1 and a fire 2. My fire 1, my husband uses, so for back up I have a fire 2. It takes nice pics as well. The fire will make a very nice gift for someone oh, don\\'t forget your free books you can download!! Bought this as a gift/prize for a Project Graduation party. The winner was super excited! This kindle does everything i want and more. No regrets on the purchase I purchased this tablet for my mother-in-law and she loves it. Its fast, connects well, every amazon aspect of life you could possibly want is on here. Thats what I didnt expect, it being my first tablet. Amazon gets in your face about all its promos and products every time i turn it on. Its so annoying. -But its very handy, very sleek, easy to use and connects quick to any wifi acess around. However its limited on games and its app store is c.r.a.p compared to android. So ehhh 50/50. Late gift for my grandson. He is very happy with it. Easy for him (9yo ). I\\'m not super thrilled with the proprietary OS on this unit, but it does work okay and does what I need it to do. Appearance is very nice, price is very good and I can\\'t complain too much - just wish it were easier (or at least more obvious) to port new apps onto it. For now, it helps me see things that are too small on my phone while I\\'m traveling. I\\'m a happy buyer. I purchased this Kindle Fire HD 8 was purchased for use by 5 and 8 yer old grandchildren. They basically use it to play Amazon games that you download. Great tablet for a great price. No need to purchase an overpriced tablet for children I haven\\'t had my Fire long enough to have explored all it has to offer. I\\'ve downloaded a couple of audio books that sound great and are easy to install and play. Not my way to watch movies or TV but the screen is nice. Very clear and sharp. Audio is just OK from the speakers, you\\'ll want some nice head phones or buds for music or movies. I really like the Fire 8, it seems like a lot of gadget for the money. I use this tablet often. It is the perfect size. The battery last a long time. The quality is great for the price Easy operation, great product, not a fan of the shiny screen, hard to see in sunlight Love my purchase of my Amazon fire Hd 8. It was a very good experience Love it, vivid HD color, it replaces other devices I have. Watch movies, play games, read e books. Happy with the purchase, found it on sale could not pass it up! the salesgirl was very knowledgeable and helped me pick out the right tablet for my needs. It works well as promised. Good size screen and clarity for the money. Seems fairly robust. The biggest problem is putting apps on it, at least free games. They do not have a great selection and when I put them on some of them require you turn on tracking so they can collect information or they won\\'t let you play it Good tablet overall just not enough memory but with an sd card just love it It was great and great for the kids and adults thanks my 9 yr old loves her new tablet . she had a nabi and likes this better Love the Tablet. Wonderful battery life. Great for Movies. This is a good tablet for the price. I dont have a lot of apps. I use more for reading and watch videos. I think is a good deal. I bought this item for one of my interns and she loved it. it\\'s a great tablet for the money. I would buy another. It does everything I need a table to do. And it is really fast.. The product has a $90 price tag and the 90 warranty is too short. My tablet died within a month. I took it to Best Buy where they said they don\\'t handle the warranty, went to Amazon web site where they said go to the store where I bought the device. After much digging around Amazon web site I found out who would help me. I gave it a one star and Amazon helped me quick. We were able to get it going again, a manual would help. The device works again. I found the tablet to be very functional, I watch Netflix, listen to Spotify, watch YouTube videos, it works great! Excellent product for what it does. Spouse loves it!Nough said! Easy to use and lots of handy features. Downside is the ads that apparently can\\'t be shut off and you can\\'t upload and and play downloaded YouTube videos unless you are online. Works great for my teenage son. He uses it for reading, playing games, and watching movies I purchased this tablet for my granddaughter and she just loves it...so much I have to take on the week days ... I love this kindle works great for me I will be ordering another one today for my wife. \\xa0I needed a tablet to keep at the hospital during overnight stays so I decided based on price to get the kindle 8 and I am pleased I did! For only $89 the bright picture, sound, storage, and ease of use is well worth it. This is a great tablet for downloading books & movies. It also takes pictures as well as surfing the web. All in all very satisfied with purchase Very Nice upgrade! Love the speed to watch movies and to play games! I broke my Fire 7 and decided to move up to the 8 and could not be more happy. I bought this for reading but love the extras. Works great! Great reading options. I like my Amazon fire-easy to use - user friendly.I liked the size - 8\" . It has made my life much easier since having hand surgery! Easy to check my email and other uses! Absolutely love my kindle. There was a glare on the screen when I was out in the sun, but once my eyes got adjusted it was just fine! I was looking for a tablet within a reasonable price range, after doing a little research I decided to give the kindle a try and it was a GREAT decision! It has so many uses and makes it so much easier to get things done than using my phone. I would recommend for any age. I love my new kindle. It was a birthday gift to myself. Best decision I could have made. A lot of bells and whistle. I love it because it was to navigate. Heck, I am doing this review on my kindle. Best Fire tablet at a reasonable price. Much faster than the 7 inch. I like the size of the device as well as the expandable storage Bought this for my wife to replace her old one and she loved it Good enough for the price. Great for Amazon subscriptions and Amazon shopping. I enjoy the kindle fire but it is not meant for heavy lifting. Good for reading books and web searching but Amazon App store doesnt have many of the normal apps found in Google Play or Apple App Store. Great value for the price however wonderful, I have 3 more at home, worth the money. This is my second Amazon Fire. My first was the 7 inch and love the new 8 HD. I am impressed with the quality and speed of this tablet. I was a little worried about not having access to the Google Play store, but this has not been a big issue so far. The speed, functionality, and battery life have exceeded my expectations. Good for price. One should not expect the quality of iPad from this product Bought the device as a gift for someone and so can\\'t comment on the usage, however it was a good price for a device that seems very versatile to me. Bought this for my mom and she loves it. Very user friendly The only thing that I don\\'t like about it is that the screen is not made to be seen in the sunlight. If I wanted to take it to the beach or poolside to read, I would not be able to see it in the sunlight. Otherwise it is terrific! It\\'s a nice updated tablet. No problems yet. Decent price for what you get Replacement tablet for my wife - no complaints! She watches Netflix on it a lot. This tablet was inexpensive, very lightweight, and performs just as good as the more expensive ones. A rating of 3 starts is what I can give this product. The Fire HD8 show a nice picture and is used mostly to watch NetFlix. However, the Fire HD8 will restart when the battery indicators is at 35%. I am not sure what is causing the issue or why. Good product for listening to and reading books. Also works well when u don\\'t want to carry an expensive and heavy laptop. We use this for streaming and games. It is a great value for the money. My wife got this for her Kindle books so she can read on the go Mom likes this allot, once she started using it. She was hesitant at first because it\\'s something new! But that didn\\'t last long. Nice screen, got it at discounted price for my kid, replaced a smaller one he broke. Tip add a child proff cover. The migration executive experience amazing! Picked up from cloud and i was good to go! Good features, good cost. Recommend to anyone looking for tablet. Great product... easy to use! Compatible with everything I want to use it for. Bought this for my son,, the size is perfect not too small not too big. Kid friendly..and easy to use. Overall o rate it 5 stars..no problems to list I purchased this to download books for school. Screen too small and OS was not to my liking If you want a simple tablet to watch shows and play games this is it. The constant ads from Amazon are annoying however. Love this tablet. Easy to use. And price was right Bought it for tbe grandson to play games on. It is ok for that. I have had Nook tablets before and I think tbey are a little better than the Amazon. It does fine for what we bought it for. This is a great tablet for people that are new to tablets and do not want to spend much money on it. It\\'s a very nice tablet and very economic tool, my kids enjoy it and I love the parental controls too This was a present for my son, but he seems to be enjoying it, so it must be ok Nothing but problems after a month. Luckily I could take it back and get a credit for the kindle to put towards an ipad. It started off working fine then after a month it started losing internet connection randomly (while the old ipad had no problems). Then it stopped charging, never got past 1%. Tried different outlets, different android chargers. Nothing. Worthless It\\'s definitely a must have. I like to read books also browse social media and the web. Must have I really was looking for a simple, cheap tablet to play games and mess around on. Screen is really nice and it serves it\\'s purpose well. Video and games both work really well on them. The only real negative about the tablet is that the cameras are not good. I really don\\'t need them so I don\\'t use them and it\\'s not a big deal for me. Our daughter loves her new tablet. It has a bigger screen more features and she just enjoys being on it. The kindle is priced right and is easy to use. She was able to get her apps transferred to her new tablet in no time. Great investment. Best tablet for the money and then some, loads fast, good quality graphics too. I needed to upgrade my electronics since I haven\\'t bought a tablet in a couple of years. What I had at home wouldn\\'t stream what I wanted to see. I went in looking for a 10in and came out with this 8in after the sales assoc. showed me its features & answered my questions. Much more portable than a 10in would have been too. If you are looking for a tablet to read books, play games, watch netflix or amazon, and to travel with, look no further. This tablet has everything you need. it does not have the greatest camera, but you have a phone for that. No reason to spend more money on anything else. You get what you pay for... This is not great, the functionality and limitations leave much to be desired. Should have spent more and got another Samsung Galaxy Tab. Great for travel when you want to read in vacation. I really love my kindle its easy to handle to. I have 3. was cheap, can not run chrome stuff, returned to store. Bought this for my mom as an upgrade to her older non-HD Kindle Fire and it is an improvement on all fronts - bigger better screen, better speakers, faster processor and updated operating system plus a slot for external storage. Great price for what you get. Got this at a great price as a second tablet. The battery life is so good that I use when traveling for movie watching. Great screen and quick response times. I love my amazon fire tablet. It\\'s great to watch movies on and surf the web. I bought my daughter the kindle fire so i purchased the kindle 8 for me Better than nook also cheaper. If toy areally looking to use as a tablet not the best choice. Great for reading and basic searching. Love this tablet. Great price and does everything Iwas looking for in a tablet All four of my kids have this Kindle. They does freeze every now and again, but overall they are great. The new camera is not a favorite. The last version camera was better. My wife broke her kindle, so we tried the fire and she has loved it! About what you\\'d expect from Kindle. Bluetooth connectivity, battery life all good I bought this tablet to replace another one that had died. it works of my purposes but one thing to note this is an Amazon device and does not have google play services installed. all apps come from amazon market. I enjoy using this Kindle fire 8\". The apps are easy to install, the screen is a great size. I can even use it without my glasses. Got this tablet for my mother and liked it so much that I went and got one for myself! It runs fast for what I use it for! I bought this tablet for my 13 yr. old God-child and she loves it. This was her Christmas present. Bought it for my wife she loves it and I would but one for my self too Excellent value, great product. It has a really solid feel. I am very happy with the purchase. Have had a nook and this is easier to use and greater variety of uses and I greatly prefer it. Great apps,ease of use,love the 8in screen, camera not that great, better pics on phones this a great tablet, my grandaughter uses the kindle settings for her little girl who is in pre school This is an upgrade we purchased for Mom. She was able to use it with no problem. Alot like her previous Kindle Very happy with the Kindle tablet! Bought it to replace an old Kindle tablet. Great tablet, serves the purpose well. Basic browsing, netflix and amazon videos.Only issue is my older tablet had a mini hdmi not this one, so screen connect is only through Amazon echo.Still a good tablet! I use it to stream movies while on the tread mill at the gym This is a great Tablet at a really great price. The best part is if you happen to break it just buy a new one Bought this to replace one I had from about 6 years ago. Why did I wait so long. The newer models bigger screen is so nice and it\\'s so much faster! I HAVE NOTHING BUT GOOD THINGS TO SAY. I HAVE HAD NO PROBLEMS WITH THE TABLET AND IT KEEPS A GREAT CHARGE. GOT IT FOR A GREAT PRICE! I had bought this tablet for my sister who is wheel chair bound or she lays in her bed. She gets a lot of Joy from using the tablet.Its big screen helps her see things better. Upgraded from the original Kindle not sure why we waited so long. Works great!! Would recommend for anyone looking for a good product. Very kid friendly! WAS LOOKING FOR A NEW TABLET. .. GREAT PRICE FOR THIS ONE! This is perfect for him! Bought it as a reader for his books, which we either download from Amazon Prime or the local public library. Nice quality screen resolution, ease of use and durability are a plus. My grandson loves it, uses it all the time. Its great Great reader and tablet enjoy the video graphics nice unit. Really love my Fire HD. Very easy to browse the internet. Is an excellent EBook Reader. Amazon apps are great! The screen is big and the Kindle is easy to navigate. Having Amazon prime definitely makes it worth the investment Bought this for my elderly non-tech friendly mom. Because it\\'s so user friendly she\\'s able to navigate it and enjoy its features without assistance. It is better than we expected and couldn\\'t be happier. We love this tablet. I bought it for my 4 and 6 year old daughters for Christmas. They have been able to used them with ease. This is for my 10 year old. Love the parental settings This was my 3rd Kindle and 2nd Fire Kindle!!! I use it for EVERYTHING!!! Hardly use the laptop at ALL anymore. Would HIGHLY recommend!!! Mainly used for reading kindle books, but tablet does many other things! Goes with me everywhere I go! When I decided on this I was shopping for something but didn\\'t know what. After using I have decided this is it. Does all I need. I bought this tablet for my 4 year old granddaughters birthday and she loves it. Works well and it is easy for her to operate. Got as a gift for my mom for Mother\\'s Day . Really great This screen on the hd8 is a huge improvement over the past kindle or fire devices. The operating system is sometimes glitchy, but overall a nice system for the money. Be sure to join Amazon Prime and have access to lots of free reading downloads Affordable and kid friendly. My kids watch videos and play games on these a lot. Lots of apps, games and books to choose from! I bought this tablet to replace my old kindle fire. So far, it has exceeded my expectations. All my apps have transferred flawlessly. The battery lasts me 10-12 hours, with moderate internet use. Glad I made this purchase. We needed a new tablet and after some research this one seemed to fit our needs. Would definitely recommend this to anyone that is looking for a tablet. These two boys were thrilled with the Fire tablet. Every time I see them they are glued to the tablet. They both have said it is the best present EVER. Extra points to the grandfather on these gifts! Unsure if I wanted to get another kindle or an Amazon tablet. Very happy with my purchase. Easy to use and a great price! This is a great Amazon Fire HD8. I love the size. So much better than my first Kindle. has good download speed. great color and clarity. sound also very good Bought for grandson ,he loves it\\'s! He uses it daily after home work done. it was a good buy for when the had them on sale. I use it as my travel tablet I love this Kindle Fire....I bought it as a reader but really about the only thing I can\\'t do on it is make phone calls. Great price for a great product. The Fire 8 was purchased for me for after I had a knee replacement. I used it to view and check my emails, facebook, Netflix, Xfinity movies and TV shows. I had an older Kindle but it got a virus. The only thing I have against this one is that it gets very hot. Best Buy did not carry covers for it. got as a replacement for young child. worked well for him. This is a great value tablet, great screen great apps. Highly recommend for media/games. I\\'ll probably buy another We bought one for my son and he liked it so much we bought another one for my other son. We did upgrade to the 8 inch screen. Purchased it for in law. She loves it and has no problems with it. I bought this as a Christmas present on Black Friday for an incredible price Easy to use and has a lot of games and books available. Good memory and you can\\'t beat the price! I\\'m planning on returning this tablet just as soon as I can!` I bought this to replace a 3-year old Kindle Fire 7\" HDX that I had just dropped on the floor. I sort of panicked, so after doing a couple of hours of research I picked this tablet. Just to be on the safe side I got 16 additional GB of memory. I installed a couple of games (none of them memory hogs) and a cookbook app, in addition to downloading a couple of books and dictionaries. I can honestly say this is the slowest tablet I\\'ve ever had. Just rotating the screen takes 7-10 seconds, and that\\'s if there\\'s only one app open. Opening a book or magazine can take half a minute, and God help you if you want to switch between a recipe and a magazine while you\\'re cooking! Amazon is obviously more concerned about showing you constant special offers and apps than having satisfied customers. Since there are no other Fire tablets available for whatever reason (maybe they\\'re being discontinued?) I\\'ll be replacing it with either an iPad or a Galaxy tablet. Great starter tablet for any one looking to not spend much money. I bought this for a gift and my little niece got in love with it HD 8\" tablet 16G on sale for $64.99 thats $25 dollars less then ever before. And alexa included. Glad I upgraded to the Fire Kindle as it is much easy to read on than the black and white Kindle I had previously. The color and graphics are very clear. It is easy to work on for many tasks, and the search mode is great. Overall I am satisfied with the tablet. Nice looking screen and decent sounding speakers. Loads of content kids and adults. Nice device! This is our first tablet, we were looking for a tablet to get us started and this is nice and inexpensive way to get started. We will use this for a while to get used to the whole app thing. I bought this to replace an older kindle that broke. It has more features, like front/ rear facing camera and better resolution screen. I feel like it doesn\\'t work as well though. The screen doesn\\'t always respond. The Internet freezes a lot. The colors seem to be a little off. All in all, still a decent piece for the price. I purchased the Kindle fire to replace my iPad that stopped working. It is so much easier to use and lighter than an iPad. I wish I had purchased one years ago. Kindles are easy to carry when traveling on long flights. Can\\'t believe I waited so long to get a real e-reader. So easy to read from. Nice tablet from Amazon, has a good screen on it and plenty of memory. My grandson loves it! It\\'s exactly what he needed. I\\'m very pleased with it, and so is he! I loved my old kindle but this new kindle is easy to use and has added security that I didn\\'t have with my old kindle. as above but interface is confusing and swipes are sometimes not recognized. Great for games and reading. Price was great. Great battery life. Well worth the money. Its awesome and of course better than the last gen. Love the HD screen. Picked this up in hopes the kids would read more than usual. It worked not only that but the entire family enjoys it. Perfect size. Exactly what I was looking for. Highly recommend this to anyone. It works fine, but sensitive to swipe on one side. This tablet has worked perfectly since I got it in April. The special offers are only on the lock screen and it works with all my apps. It\\'s very responsive and the screen resolution is great. Easy to use and great selection of books movies and games. We got these as an upgrade for the kids\\' Kindle Fires. Work great and have had no issues. The specs are good, feels solid, can\\'t stand the OS. Too many ads you can\\'t get rid of, not as customizable as I\\'d like. If that doesn\\'t bother you, it\\'s a good tablet for the price. Don\\'t expect to run games on it, not powerful enough for that. I bought one and gave this one as a gift- much appreciated and great price. I needed something that\\'s not an ipad for basic app use and it works great, minimal glare even with a screen protector (again, it\\'s not iPad, but it\\'s good for a tablet) Very easy to use and does everything I need it to do. I use it to read emails and watch Netflix Very easy to use. The Kindle app works well. Regular tablet search simple games email all work fine sometimes a little slow. I used this as my travel tablet and teader. The advertising is a pain but helps keep the price down. Goo graphics and easy to use. Does much more than you think. A perfect gift. Great Fire tablet! Speedy service and experience! Bravo! This is a cheap tablet but really worth for the price. I bought this when it is on sale for $69 + $40 for 128 GB SD card, you have a great tablet when plenty of space. I used ipad for a while but i think it is so overpriced . This tablet is a deal !!! Excellent replacemwnt for an older model of rhe kindle. This is our 2nd one, my wife was using my most of the time, so I got her one. good little tablet. I use it for entertainment. no issues hooking it up to my network. It reads my textbooks to me while I play card games. Why did I wait so long to buy this thing? I should add that I am an Amazon Prime member so that might be needed to take full advantage of this feature. Cortonna will read all of my books to me. I didn\\'t have to upgrade my books or pay extra per book. Got this for my mom, so she could check facebook without getting on her computer. So far, no problems, even tho she\\'s not tech savvy. Enjoy having a device that I did not have to pay for through the nose. Enjoy having a device that makes it easier to read on the go. Great light weight tablet that uploads quickly. Would recommend. I need a tablet for reading ebooks and search dictionary for new vocabulary. This one fit my need and it can also check email, listen music and go online searching stuff. I have iPad at home and put this at office, so I don\\'t need to bring the same tablet back and forth. It suits my need very well. This is a very responsive device for the amount paid Amazon - Fire HD8 - 8 - Tablet - 16GB - Wi-Fi - Black I purchased this for my sister. I really appreciate the Geek Squad for setting this product up for her and for teaching me how to use it. Now I can pass that I learned onto my sister. Kindle was great purchase for both of my teenage sons.Great for use of apps and music. Good for everyday use. Would recommend to anybody. Inexpensive, but well built. Easy navigation. Streams movies well. Sound is decent, but requires headphones generally. Screen is good size and clear. Finding a case for this model is a challenge - I found on-line, but expensive considering tablet price. Universal cases don\\'t work due to button placement. 8 years old daughter is happy with this tables,work very well with wifi and is easy to download app. Perfect for basic stuff, games and media. Reading, too. Fast working tablet but very limited on apps. I like it but it was not really for me. Only apps available were from the Amazon app store so many apps that I hoped to use were unavailable. So it is good for limited use. Purchased for book reading but works well as a tablet. Wasn\\'t thinking that it would be a full replacement for my old IPad but working well as one. Prior to using the device I decided to recharge it to 100% and was shocked to find out that it takes 6 hours. Unless you have a lot of time don\\'t buy this device. whats to say.................................................it\\'s Kindlelishous!!!!!!!!!!!!! I purchased this as a Mother\\'s Day gift for my Mom in Florida. I don\\'t have first hand experience with it but the price point is great and the other reviews seem solid. I did watch a few unboxing videos on youtube and it seems to be a great deal. Some people seem to have issues with the screen being too glossy but other than that I don\\'t see a ton of other problems. This tablet has beautiful color graphics and is super thin. Easy to carry with you. This fit my criteria of a low cost tablet that works well My son loves his new tablet. He goes on it as soon as he gets home from school. and it holds a LOT of data plus you can add more storage... been using it a lot. Better than I expected. Parental control is an awesome feature. I was looking for a kids tablet for my grandson but this one is so much better because it can grow with him and it has a kids mode on it which is really nice so he can\\'t order or go online without permission. He loves this tablet and it\\'s very well build . We bought the Fire as an easy way for our 97 year old mother to see pictures of the family from all over the country. It was very simple to set up and learn to use. She plays games on it, as well...... Cant beat it for the money, plus its very durable.... My 8 year old niece cracked her screen on her former tablet, I needed to get her a replacement. This tablet fit the bill exactly, a great screen, relatively fast CPU, and best of all, it\\'s cheap!I was able to find instructions online for installing Google PlayStore, in which I then gave her the tablet. She loves it! I love the Amazon HD8! It is a great tablet for reading and surfing the web! It has a fast processor and amazing resolution. I would definitely purchase this product again. Great product for my 8 year & affordable.. had 2 months & no problems Great but I wouldn\\'t use it for a sole purpose as being my primary tablet A perfect tablet at a reasonable cost. Why pay higher prices for bells and whistles you don\\'t use. The back lit feature is great for reading in low light conditions. I got a kindle fire when they first came out. Time to update and great choice, good graphic, great for catching up on your favorites show better than watching on a phone!! The Kindle Fire HD is perfect for playing simple games and for streaming video while away from home. It\\'s thin and light. Bought this for my daughter. She loves it. Wifi connection is great. She mostly uses YouTube and google. Love the easy way to control parental accounts from my account. Very useful. I did buy a cover to put on it, because it\\'s so thin, I was afraid it would break. I bought this tab for my daughter\\'s birthday.its got a good screen and sound for the price. I also play for the children\\'s app freetime which is perfect for her. Really good tablet. Very nice picture. Really easy to use. I needed a kindle for my schooling so I decided to look into this and read some reviews. After reading the reviews I decided on this kindle and it is perfect compared to my other tablet. Like the ability to play a game or 2 when I take a break from reading... Easy to use, light weight, fits in a small purse or bag. I like the Amazon Platform that it is on as it ties into my Amazon account. still learning new things about my tablet. very easy to use.. perfect size. We have been using our Kindle Fire 7 for years and it wore out. We looked at replacing it with another Fire 7 until I saw the Fire 8. The display is great and the weight is not that big of a difference. Enjoy the multifaceted opportunities that are available with the Kindle This tablet is very easy to set up and use- it\\'s just as advertised. I had the original Kindle and just decided to upgrade. It \\u200bis a very functional and easy to use. My 10 year old daughter loves it. Battery great to Several friends suggested I buy the Kindle Fire. I love it!! Great for traveling! I can check my email, update my Facebook status and read all from one device. I had a new one but it stopped working....So I just went and bought a new one. Works great!! Loved it very good screen quality and clarity, of course its amazon so alot of the regular google play store stuff from androids isnt Available, but they have there own version of stuff that is good also, my kids loved it, i loved it, i highly recommend buying it. But if your hooked on google play id go with a Samsung tablet. Very lightweight and portable with excellent battery life. I like this so much more than the Voyage. The shape makes for easier holding. I only wish this devise was maybe 2 inches taller then it would look like a real book Replacing older reader without a light and traveling overseas soon. With electronics in the cabin under scrutiny, this very small and very lightweight reader fits the bill! Perfect in small purses and large pockets. I can read without annoying seatmate with cabin overhead seat light. Easy to hold in either hand and screen adjusts for whichever direction you\\'re holding it. This is my first e-reader. I didn\\'t know about the odd refresh and it took a little while to get used to but I do love how small and light it is and that I do not have to remember to plug it in everyday This kindle is awesome. I love the design of it. Nothing software wise that was different than my other kindle but the way it\\'s designed makes it much more comfortable and easier to read. The only reason I didn\\'t give it five stars was because of the price. If it were cheaper, this kindle would have been five stars no doubt. The new Kindle is a great gift and fantastic entertainment idea. Met all my expectations! Lightweight and compact. I enjoy using the product. I thought long and hard about upgrading from my paperwhite, but decided to do so despite not beating able to actually see one in the store. I have owned a Kindle since the second generation version. This is by far my favorite. The look and feel are amazing. I don\\'t regret the purchase one bit as I have the disposable income to do so, but for most the paperwhite will more than suffice at a significantly smaller price point. I own a Kindle HDX 8.9 and wanted something small and portable... WOW is all I can say when I got my hands on the Kindle Oasis ( Thank you Babes :) ). The Kindle Oasis is very tiny, portable & fits in about anything from a jeans back pockets to a very very small purse! The clarity of the screen is awesome. The touch of it works perfect! Very different than my HDX BUT I HIGHLY RECOMMEND it! A little more pricey than the paperwhite BUT this one already comes with the case and a built in battery in the case so you are set for long time reading & the price is fair since the others you would still have to buy a case for it! Keep in mind the case for the oasis is leather and you can choose from black, brown and red (red was my choice., which to me it\\'s not red it\\'s more of a wine red color) it\\'s beautiful! Picture shows My Kindle Oasis in the middle of the IPhone 7 Plus (left) & Samsung S8+ (right) so you can get an idea on the size... it\\'s super cute! It\\'s tinier than the Kindle paperwhite! Got me reading again! Love the merlot cover. This one is the smallest of all the kindle products I believe, and that\\'s a big reason I picked. Also the lightest I believe. Battery life is forever.Two negative points are the Amazon logo in the cover, and the fact you can\\'t do inverted text (black background white text).Those 2 points dropped it from 4 to 5 star for me.Still highly recommended. easy to read books this way. enjoyable at night in the bedroom or outside in the afternoon. I purchased the Kindle Oasis because I was growing increasingly tired of the glare and cumbersome size of reading off my iPad. So the portability is great. And of course, I went for the most expensive, because I wanted the extra battery life. And while the length of time it stays charged is nice, charges very quickly, it\\'s still overpriced. I love the non-glare screen, you can literally read this anywhere. But the wifi connectivity is patchy at best. I have to go upstairs in my home and stand close to the router for the Oasis to connect, this is very annoying. Wouldn\\'t be a big deal if I only read from this one device. But I read from another and picking up where I left off is a pain most times. Non of my issues are really a big deal, but for $300 I don\\'t feel like I should have any issues. This is my second Kindle and I couldn\\'t be happier . I couldn\\'t believe I would be happy with something so small , but it is great And easy to take along anywhere . I started to buy the Voyage but when I saw how close the price was to the Oasis, I decided to go ahead and buy the Oasis. So glad I did! I love the case and the physical buttons to turn the page. It is so lightweight and I love the option of the screen rotating whenI need to change hands. Awesome device! Was afraid to spend so much money for a kindle but so far I am glad I did. Love everything about it. The buttons to turns pages, screen resolution, lighting, how easy and light it is when you hold it. Case is beautiful. Enjoy reading on it. Great item! Would definitely recommend this item -- am still learning all the things about it. This product may be extremely overpriced, but it also lives up to everything it\\'s promised. It\\'s a lightweight, long-lasting ereader that is much easier on the eyes than an iPad. It is much lighter and more ergonomical than a paperback, and I find myself renting kindle copies of books I already own just to take advantage of the device\\'s convenience. Upgraded from my old Kindle keyboard. I love the ability to adjust brightness and font. I have small hands and this is not too big to hold in one hand. I was able to change the page turning buttons for left handed use. The charging cover last a long time. I wish there were more colors to choose from. This is not an upgrade by any means! My three year old kindle outperformed Oasis.Battery life better than a week with the lights on lowest setting Magnetic connector is poorly designed and grows weak Two pieces to keep up with; unsnaps constantly Amazon Customer Services promises it will resolved in an update Its a great ereader but a little pricy. It has the same specs as the Voyage as far as pixels and procesor, which costs less. The only difference between this and the Voyage, is that it\\'s much lighter, it\\'s brighter (LEDs), and a longer battery life if you\\'re using the cover. I\\'ve noticed the battery life drains much faster without the cover, but you\\'ll still be able to read for hours without it. You would think it be water resistant, hence the name but it isn\\'t. But then I don\\'t plan on reading when it\\'s raining or outside or while taking a bath. Overall, it\\'s the best ereader Amazon currently has to offer but if you don\\'t mind the price tag and want the best, then go for it! Voyage is still not a bad option though Great ebook for a beginner. Light and good looking I have had a Kindle for some time and was curious about the Oasis. It did not disappoint. It is very compact, even with the cover, and fits in a coat pocket. I really enjoy the size and the redesign which brings back hard buttons. Great device for home or on the go. Battery life is unreal! So much faster than my old kindle. This Kindle reader with cover attached is light weight and easy reading. Page turner is easy to use and it reverses so you can hold with either hand. I am very happy and satisfied with this product. Happy reading - The new design, compared to my old kindle paperwhite and voyage, looked weird when I first got my Kindle Oasis. After I used it for a while (5 hours), I felt the design was kind of make sense. When I hold it with one hand (right hand), the centre of gravity position was right in my hand, so there was less change that I drop the kindle on my face(when I was laying on my bed, it happened a lot with my kindle voyage) I\\'ve been a kindle owner since the early days and when new versions have come out in the past, it was usually a no-brainier to upgrade. The oasis was a little challenging because the price really makes you stop and think if this upgrade is worth it. After a lot of thought, the factor that convinced me to switch was the reappearance of the page turning buttons. I missed them since they vanished with the kindle keyboard! The paper white and the voyage were great devices but I often accidentally changed pages if I accidentally pinched the bezel when carrying the device or even just shifting positions on the couch. The Oasis\\' buttons have removed that issue and I am delighted! The weight and thinness of the device are also appreciated tho the paper white etc are pretty thin already. The addition of the cover is interesting but after a month\\'s use I think it\\'s pretty clear the cover/battery is there only to boost the very short-lived battery in the kindle itself. \"Months\" of battery life just seems impossible unless you keep the screen at low illumination and only read a few minutes a day. The screen is clear and bright, I can\\'t see any LED issues others have complained about and the interface does seem snappier than older versions. Ultimately the only real justification for buying this kindle is if you miss the page turn buttons and want to pay top dollar for them. Otherwise, the existing kindles will meet your needs. I would definitely buy it again, but it does not have the ambient light sensor like the cheaper voyage does to turn the brightness up and down automatically in the dark or sun. For a product of this price, it shouldn\\'t be missing any features. Otherwise it is great, light, and the text refreshes quickly and is crisp. Very nice Kindle with a great Battery life. My old kindle was not able to upgrade so I got the new Kindle and very pleased with the product. Arrived as promised from BESTBUY.COM. This is a great device. It is ultra light, and a pleasure to use. It also has a very satisfying premium feel. The price, of course, is not worth it.. unless you can afford it. There are cheaper models of the kindle with similar screen resolution....but if you CAN afford it, I highly recommend it. Th size difference is noticeable and squarish rather then rectangular, which I prefer. The Kindle unit itself is rather nice, the auto rotate and adjust being the best part. I returned this item b/c the cover is flimsy. and I was afraid I would drop it and break the kindle. lightweight and convenient to use. love my new kindle I purchased this as a gift for my wife and she loves it. She has an older Kindle, and she can\\'t believe how much better the Oasis is. Kindles are an excellent device for all book lovers Great for reading in the sunlight. As well as light, and easy on the wrist. Great product, but a little speedy. As a previous several Kindle device owner I read a lot of reviews, many of them put the Voyage above it for various reasons, mainly price, or battery charging. But, after reading the pros and cons of both I still decided the Oasis was the direction I wanted to go, I could always return it and get the Voyage after all if I didn\\'t like it. It\\'s light, very well lit, comfortable to hold both in the case and out of it. The buttons improve the page turning experience, I see no dark areas on my screed from the LED lights, it holds a great battery charge (true not as good as my previous Kindle, but I still generally get around 3 weeks between charges), and it looks absolutely beautiful. I am very happy with this purchases and am glad I purchased the Oasis over the Voyage. It\\'s expensive, and that\\'s the major con, but if you want the best reading device this is it and worth it if you read enough. New to eBooks and researched available eReaders and tablets. What I like best about the OASIS is the weight (lightest on the market), battery life (measured in weeks not hours) and the capability to use it in bright sunlight. Recommend it for all. I am a book addict and this is my 4th kindle device. This is by far the best one. It is so compact it is almost smaller than my large wallet. Can fit anywhere. Holds a charge incredibly well and very nice display to make reading fun. I read a lot and have loved my kindle paperwhite and used it all the time. I didn\\'t think it could get any better! I read all about the kindle Oasis and it sounded great but the price was freaking me out and I kept thinking I really didn\\'t need it! Well I finally talked myself into just trying it and after just taking it out of the box and holding it I was sold. It is so lightweight and so easy to hold and the screen is wonderful! The charging case is so convenient and so easy to take off and put on and it really looks nice. I never keep it on when I\\'m reading which keeps the kindle oasis light. I am so glad that I went for it and bought it. I want to read more than ever now. It is always in my purse. Believe me, I am not made of money in the least but I am so glad that I purchased this. If you are an avid reader you will be too! Excellent reader night or day, sunshine or shade. Not as full function as earlier kindels There\\'s no doubt that this is the best Kindle device available. The battery life is astonishing, and the design is unique and extremely ergonomic. Holding this in your hand is such a pleasurable experience, it fits like a glove. So what are the cons you may ask...For one, the battery life depends on the provided case. It acts like a travel charger in a sense. Why a con? Well, it limits your customization options. And there\\'s no way to purchase other colors or replacements for it at this time. So, you best be cautious with it.And two, the price obviously! But if you take into account that you basically are given a premium case, the device itself is a premium device, and you have a traveling charge inside the case...It may almost even out. But a $290-$350 device is hard to justify when it\\'s just for reading.Still would recommend to any fan of e-readers/reading Nice device. But only minimally better than the Voyage. \\'ve owned the Kindle Keyboard, 2nd generation Paperwhite and now the Oasis. I love the Oasis very much. The ergonomic design is wonderful and makes it a breeze to hold. It is so light -- that is the biggest killer feature of the Oasis. The 10 LEDs look fantastic and I love the return of page buttons. I\\'ve never had one where the screen is flush with the bezel so this is great. All in all, this is easily the best Kindle ever made and even though it\\'s a bit spendy, it will be the one future Kindles are measured against. I have had every kindle since the first and this is by far the best. The screen was already great on the Voyage but the front light on this screen is more white and more evenly distributed. Physical page turn buttons are so much better than none or the haptic feedback type. They didn\\'t include the automatically adaptive front light for some reason but I don\\'t think I\\'ll miss it much as I was always wont to fiddle with it on the Voyage anyway.But this device made me smile as soon as I held it for the first time because it has a larger bezel that you can really grip comfortably without touching the screen. Maybe this isn\\'t a big deal for most, but that is exactly why I spent the money to get this device.The other thing I was hoping for was the ability to use the upper page turn button to go forward and this device does that and even better because it is software configurable.The cover is very small and light and doesn\\'t add much bulk like the Voyage Origami case does. The only downside is that it doesn\\'t work as a hands free stand for reading.(I still wish it was waterproof) Despite not being able to get one of these from Amazon until late June due to apparent strong demand, Best Buy was able to get one to me on the day of its release, April 27. Well done Best Buy! Having owned several previous Kindles, including the most recent Paperwhite model, I was unprepared for how small and light this new Oasis model is -- reading about it is one thing, but actually holding one in your hand is something else entirely. The Oasis and its battery-charging cover together weigh only one ounce more than the latest Paperwhite with no case. The Oasis _without_ its cover feels impossibly light at 4.6 ounces. Size-wise, the Oasis is nearly a square shape at about 5\" wide by 5.5\" tall. In fact, the shape is so different from traditional Kindle designs that I had to compare it next to my Paperwhite to verify that the screens are actually the same size (they are). It\\'s the first Kindle I think I could easily fit into a jacket pocket without any effort, For frequent travelers like me, this is a key reason to buy one of these, as it\\'s extremely compact and easy to pack in a briefcase or purse. The screen is the first front-lit Kindle I\\'ve ever seen where you simply cannot see any trace of the LEDs from any angle. No dark spots, no bright spots...just a completely uniform illumination from edge to edge in both directions. The \"page\" also appears to be nearly flush with the top glass surface, helping achieve the illusion of printed paper. It\\'s sharp and clear, better than any Kindle I\\'ve used. The reader can be easily separated from the battery case by simply pulling them apart, since they are held together with magnets. After doing so, this is where the Amazon engineering team\\'s achievements really become clear, as you just won\\'t believe how lightweight this thing is. It\\'s easy to imagine holding onto it for hours without any arm fatigue, and switching from hand to hand is a simple matter of rotating it 180 degrees when switching. The display instantly rotates, and the page turn buttons also \"follow\", with the top button always used to advance the page, and the bottom button always used to go backward. You can also use the screen to change pages as you always have with earlier touch screen models. The battery on the reader has a lower capacity than the cover\\'s battery, so it runs down faster if you don\\'t have it connected to the case. It\\'s very easy to snap the reader back into its cover, which allows it to recharge while you continue to read. The power button and charge port are located in the upper top-right corner, more or less opposite from where they are on the Paperwhite. I find this location to be less awkward, as it\\'s easier to reach on the top than it is on the bottom edge. The back surface of the reader (not the case) seems to easily attract fingerprints, and they are not so easy to clean off. You\\'d think that Amazon would have figured out a way to prevent this by now. It\\'s a minor annoyance. Lots of reviewers in the tech press have complained loudly about this model\\'s high price relative to other Kindle models (without ads, it\\'s $310 vs. $139 for an ad-less Paperwhite). Is this a lot of money? Perhaps, but if you are a book addict and value an extremely lightweight reader that\\'s easy on both your arms and your eyes, then I personally think it\\'s worth it. A lot of thought and effort clearly went into designing and building this unit, and the price reflects that. Is it for everyone? Probably not, but there is obviously a market for it when you consider how many months you\\'ll have to wait to get one on Amazon\\'s website. If you are a serious reader, this device deserves a very close look -- I\\'m definitely keeping mine! I got oasis yesterday, very lighweight compared to voyager, screen size comparable, like having actual page turn button, touchscreen seems kinda slow, the on/off button on top is improvement from back of voyager. cover does seem kind of flimsy, but supposed to be leather so will see how it holds up. finding it easier to hold with cover on, then removed. cover doesn\\'t have separate charge port, so all charging is done thru kindle. BestBuy delivered this on the day of release. Amazon still seems to be back-ordered. It is a great product. Nice and light with uniform screen and snappy performance. Got this for my wife and she loves it. Compact library on the go for an avid reader. Kindle Oasis is phenomenal... It is portable size so it fits almost anywhere when I travel, the book-like screen doesn\\'t bother my eyes after long periods of time of reading, I can modify the font and size to my wants and needs, you can conveniently connect to your Goodreads account to view your bookshelves and all of my purchases sync perfectly. The color Merlot is beautiful and I\\'ve had it for three months and traveled with it and there have been no damages. The battery life is so long I have only charged it three times since owning it and I read anywhere from 3-5 hours a day. Completely user friendly. Small, light, but comfortable to hold with either hand. If you keep it in airplane mode with medium lighting, the battery last for weeks. Lovin\\' it so far. Would give it a 5 star if the battery lasted as long as they claim. But it\\'s worth the extra charging times for the nice design. So light and easy in your hand especially without the cover. But, using the cover is comfortable as well. The leather cover smells a bit when it arrives but I let it air out for a few days before using it and now it\\'s fine. Nice quality leather and I love the merlot color. The page turn buttons are easier to use than the buttons on the voyage. Screen looks the same even though they claim there are more backlights on this one. I\\'m very happy with my Oasis. Almost feels like reading a book in a light comforting way. Easy to carry around. Great on eyes and reading is enjoyable When they first announced the Kindle Oasis, I did not have much of a desire to upgrade from my 1st generation Kindle Paperwhite. Just as I felt when they announced the Voyage.I read a lot, so my Kindle travels with me throughout the day most of the time. I have never had an issue with battery life, I have only had it get really low a few times (typically when I was traveling). So again, I originally did not see a lot of the value to the Oasis.As the reviews for the Oasis came out, I started to realize what I did not like about my Paperwhite, and I began to have an interest in upgrading my Paperwhite to the either the Oasis or possibly the Voyage. The main thing I noticed is that I took my Paperwhite out of the Amazon case quite a lot, especially when I was in a seated position. This slight reduction in weight made it much more comfortable to hold for longer reading sessions. I had some other minor issues with my Paperwhite, like when reading in the dark, I couldn\\'t find an adjustment for the light that I preferred (5 was a little too dim and 6 was a brighter than I needed). I decided to pass on the Voyage because I really did not like the case options and the pressure sensitive page turn option.Now that I have the Oasis, I definitely think it was worth it for me. I really appreciate the reduced weight when the cover is off (not to mention the ease of removing the cover compared to the Paperwhite). It provides the same reading experience, although I did get a resolution upgrade compared to my older Paperwhite, which is a plus.The Oasis is really comfortable in my hand, which helps me forget that it is there. When I was holding my Paperwhite with my left hand, at times I would accidentally go back a page, which drove me crazy even though its just a minor inconvenience.I have the black model because it was the only option available unless I was willing to wait a few more months. The build quality of the Oasis and its case is very nice, just like with the Paperwhite and the amazon leather case for it. The only concern I have is how well it will protect the Kindle. I will update the review if I find this to be a problem.I loved my Paperwhite, and I will recommend it to anyone looking to upgrade from an older Kindle or buying one for the first time. It definitely is great and the better buy, but I am glad I decided to order the Oasis. The reduced weight, ergonomic design, and page turn buttons make it worth the added cost. I bought 2 and am returning them both. Both had lighting issues. On the first one, one half of the screen had a white/blue tint and the other half was more of a yellow tint. When i flipped the device upside down to rotate to use with my other hand, half of the screen went much darker than the other. I returned it because I had read there were some that had lighting issues and bought another one. My second one was worse. You could see little half moons going down one side. That one also had a much yellower tint overall than the first one.I found it not easy to hold unless it was in the charging case. It was too slippery and, weird to say, small for me. I\\'m a female with average sized hands.I think what I really did love was the charging case and the size for transport purposes. Maybe when they make a few tweaks and lower the price I might try again. With the cover attached, the battery lasts for a good, long period. With the cover detached (which is how I use it primarily), the Oasis is so thin that it is almost weightless in your hand. The ability to switch hands (flip upside down) means one never seems to tire of holding the device to read a book; and, it fits into my pants pocket, again, perfect for traveling. The battery seems to last with heavy usage for at least several days, but I tend to reconnect the cover at night (I am assuming that helps to recharge the basic Oasis battery). Regardless, it was well worth replacing our older Kindle readers with the newer Oasis (we bought two). Easy to carry in purse or pocket but doesn\\'t do anything better than the cheapest Kindle reader. I debated buying the new Kindle Oasis, since I\\'ve owned every Kindle since the first release. It was worth the money, as the form factor is the best yet... it\\'s comfortable to hold in one hand, and the text is crisp and easy to read. Even when I’m outside in bright sunlight, the words of the book I’m reading are still crystal clear. That alone makes the Kindle Oasis worth what it cost me.The Kindle Oasis wakes up in just seconds, and any book I choose instantly opens, ready to be read.It is the perfect size and isn’t heavy or bulky. I really do read for hours at a time. Sometimes I pace the floor while I read. Sometimes I’m on my elliptical machine when I read. And sometimes I’m sitting down. No matter what I’m doing, the Kindle Oasis remains comfortable to hold, and it is always easy on my eyes.When I receive a book that is in PDF, most of the time I can enlarge the words. If it won’t allow me to enlarge the words, I can change the orientation of the page and the words are automatically larger. I am able to make notes on the book if needed, and I can highlight words and/or passages.My merlot leather cover is attractive. When I flip it open, it is just like opening the cover of a book.How to Make the Battery LastOn the Kindle Oasis page, it says that its “dual-battery charging system delivers months of battery life.” This was a huge thing for me. Instead of having to charge my tablet almost every day, I would be able to read for months without charging the Kindle!Is this how my Oasis has performed? Well, not so much. There are conditions that have to be met for the charge on your Oasis to last for two months.First, you have to limit your reading to thirty minutes a day. That one is impossible for me. There are days that I am only able to read for thirty minutes, but they don’t occur very often. My Kindle goes everywhere with me, and I use just about every spare moment to read.Second, the wireless needs to be turned off. That one is easy to do but not always easy to remember. The only time the wireless needs to be on is to download one or more books.Third, this is based on your light setting at 10. That is way too low for me. I keep my light setting anywhere from 16 to 18.I don’t limit my reading to thirty minutes a day, and I try to remember to keep my wireless turned off. My light setting is kept anywhere from 16 to 18, and I put my Kindle to sleep the second I’m done reading. So how long does a single charge last me? Ten days is the longest a charge has lasted me so far, but it would have kept a charge for several more days if I had remembered to turn my wireless off. Once I succeed in keeping my wireless off, I will let you know how long the charge lasts.Now, I don’t plug it in to charge as soon as the charge on the cover gets low. I allow my cover charge to go as low as it will possibly go and then the Kindle battery will start to drain since it can no longer charge from the cover. I allow it to drain down to about 50% before I plug the cover and Kindle into my computer to charge.The one thing that surprised me was that everything on the Oasis is in black and white. For some reason, I thought that maybe the book covers would appear in color. But since I bought the Oasis to read books on, color isn’t needed.Special offers do appear on my screen but only when my Kindle is going to sleep or waking up. They aren’t a distraction, and to be honest, they are kind of fun to look at. You can pay a higher price so they won’t appear on your Kindle if you would rather not see them.I asked myself some questions once I had my Kindle and knew just how it worked. If I had known before I bought my Kindle Oasis that the charge wouldn’t last for months, would I still have bought it? Yes, I would have. If I had known that everything would appear in black and white, would I still have bought it? Yes, I would have. Easy to handle. Light weight. I like that it automatically shuts off when the cover is closed. Bought for my wife to upgrade from the original Kindle that she has worn out. Big step up from the original and should be good for another 8-10 years. I love the snap on cover that charges the kindle. It is also very light. Wife love it, reads a lot and this is her go to reader. This is my third Kindle. The best differentiator is the form factor. Definite improvement over the paperwhite. Also like having the page-turn buttons back. Case is very cool indeed. If you can get past the jump in price (remember you\\'re not having to buy the case separately), it\\'s a quality product to have. I was so looking forward to this that I bought it right when it popped up as available on Best Buy. This is obviously the most refined Kindle on the market as of now. The ergonomics are just perfect, as there is no other Kindle or any ebook reader for that matter that is as easy to use single handed as this one. Fits perfectly in the palm and the page turn buttons are a joy to use.The charging case can be removed while reading and it snaps back easily, you do not have to deliberately align it properly. Once the case is connected it starts charging the Kindle which prolongs its battery life.In short, if you are an avid reader and can spare $290, this is the Kindle to buy. For occasional readers it might not make sense to spend so much and the Kindle Paperwhite should do just fine. I have used Kindle e-readers since Amazon introduced them years ago. All are good products and each new model has been a worthwhile upgrade. The Oasis is no exception, even from the highly touted Voyage model. It is expensive but the lightweight design, improved backlighting and battery cover are worth the additional expense for someone who reads frequently. This is definitely a good investment! This is my 4th kindle and is easily the best one I\\'ve ever had. It is very comfortable to hold and is very compact. I was surprised how small it is but has the same screen size as my other kindles. It may look costly at first but remember you are getting a cover with additional battery. This is the best kindle ereader yet. The size and weight make it perfect for comfortable reading. You will find yourself reading more books than ever with it. Actually easier to hold than a paperback, and might even be lighter! Finally received the Kindle Lighted Leather Cover for the newest version Kindle. It is VERY lightweight and I had to double and triple check the description considering it states this is a leather cover. The front cover is very thin with a medium-weight cardboard feel to it. The leather on the front cover is extremely thin and you can immediately tell the surface will be easily scratched and marred with normal everyday use. The inside of the front cover has a thin microfiber material to protect the screen. The back cover is hollowed out plastic to form-fit your Kindle and snaps in with relative ease.Using the enclosed graphic instruction card, I removed the Kindle as shown, having to use just enough pressure to make me a bit concerned for someone who would place and remove their Kindle in this cover frequently. However, I plan on using this cover as a full-time solution for both protection and as a light source.I went ahead and pulled up a book and switched the light on, heading to a closet to see how this looked in complete darkness. The light pulls out of the back cover and is nice and stiff and has a locked full-out position. The spread of the light is greater on top obviously but it does reach the entire screen on the Kindle. There was no glare or reflection and I was able to easily read the page without any noticeable straining.If I were to choose between this design and the Kindle Keyboard lighted cover, which I have used since its release, I would choose this newer cover.Read more I owned a Kindle Keyboard for about a year, and I purchased the leather lighted case for that unit. While the corner light left a little to be desired as far as even lighting, overall I was very pleased with the case. Based on that experience, I went ahead and purchased the lighted cover for my new Kindle. I can\\'t say this experience has as been as positive.Let\\'s start off with what\\'s good about the case. The Kindle battery powered light is a big improvement. The light is now centered on the screen, so illumination is more even now. I don\\'t use the light often, but in the cases where I do it will be nice to have more balanced coverage. One positive on the case itself is that I appreciate how much lighter this one feels than the previous generation. The hinge area is smaller, which means less of the spine folding effect the other one took on after heavy use. I never took my Kindle Keyboard out of the case after it was put in, so the snug fit I have seen complaints about is not an issue for me. It IS tight, though, so if you don\\'t plan to keep the case on full time be aware it may take some effort to get it back out. In my situation, that tight fit is exactly what I want, but your mileage may vary.Now on to the negatives. The case does feel very cheap, especially with no change in price point. The previous cover felt like a solidly made piece of work, whereas the new cover only feels half as sturdy. The thinness of the case was no doubt done to minimize its weight, so I realize this is a personal issue. Outside the thickness, though, it just doesn\\'t look or feel as well made. The textured surface of the previous model you that leather feel, very much like a real book. Finally, the most stunning oversight is the lack of a closure device.Read more I purchased this Kindle case in the Saddle Tan color. The leather is high quality (it has that wonderful new smell as well) and has beautiful stitching around the border on the front. The case does not add any bulk to the Kindle. I find it quite comfortable to hold in one hand or two, as the front cover folds behind the case, and I truly feel like I am holding an actual book while reading.At the top of the case, there is a plastic arm that pulls upward to reveal a light, which illuminates the screen of the Kindle perfectly in a dark room. My eyes have no trouble reading with the light activated. The light is powered by the Kindle itself, by way of two metal prongs inside the case making contact with two metal tabs on the lower back of the Kindle. The arm for the light does seem a bit delicate, and I could see a young child inadvertently breaking this if care is not shown. I fear that over time, this will be the first piece to stop functioning as the case is regularly used.My only criticism of this case is that there is no way to secure the front cover from opening. It would have been nice to include a clasp, or some kind of stretchable band to keep the case closed. I paid 54 for this case, which is almost as expensive as the Kindle itself. At that price, the designers should have had the forethought to include a means of securing the case from opening. Aside from this potential problem, this Kindle case is perfect, and adds a bit of sophistication to an already awesome device.Kudos, Amazon! I have had the Kindle Keyboard with it\\'s lighted cover and now I have the new Kindle with lighted cover. I will briefly compare them and then list the pros and cons of this cover.In comparison:-The kindle keyboard in the cover is much heavier than the new kindle in it\\'s cover. The new case does a much better job of securing the kindle as well, it is no longer hinged only on one edge, but instead it is form fit inside of a rigid rubber shell that attaches to the back of the new kindle-The lighting is about the same between both cases, but where the old case lit the screen from the top right corner, the new case lights the screen from the top middle.-I feel like the old light mechanism was more durable. The light bar on this cover is made out of very stiff, thin plastic instead of the thick rubbery plastic that contained the light on the old cover. It also hinges open instead of pulling out of the case, and the hinge feels subpar.-The light on the new case is less angled and tends to get in my eyes more when reading than the old kindle keyboard case did.All in all I still like the new case. It fits the new kindle very well and does not increase the size or weight very much. The leather is somewhat thin but not horribly so and it looks sleek on the kindle. I will be keeping this case.Pros:Compact case that looks very sleekTight and secure fitUses the Kindle\\'s batteries so no additional power is needed.Provides adequate lighting across the entire screen.Cons:Lightbar hinge seems very cheap.Since I only received this today, I cannot yet evaluate the additional drain that this case will place on the Kindle\\'s battery.Read more I read every single review for this cover before I decided to buy it, but I am glad that I finally decided to pull the trigger. I have never had a Kindle or another cover, so my review is based on a first-timer\\'s perspective. This is my feedback:1) I agree that this cover is expensive. Ridiculously expensive. But, after pricing other covers and other lights, then factoring in that I would have to buy replacement batteries for any other light, it did not seem like I would be saving much money if I bought something else. Plus, the fact that the light is built-in was very appealing and turns out to be extremely convenient.2) Yes, the cover should have had a magnet or something for closure. That was the main reason for my initial hesitation, not the price. I thought about using a rubber band around it, but some people mentioned that a rubber band would look ugly around the pretty cover (which, by the way, is quite pretty in the wine purple color). I ended up knitting a small little sleeve to slip over my Kindle cover to keep the cover closed, for additional protection, and to prevent scratches, because:3) The cover does scratch quite easily. I agree with one reviewer who did not seem to mind the scratches on the cover, because doesn\\'t that show that the cover is doing its job to protect the Kindle But, it does sound like the same cover for the Kindle Keyboard was much more durable. It would be nice for the cover to keep looking fresh and new, but I would rather my Kindle be protected than for my cover to look perfect. My little knitted sleeve is helping with that, but I know a lot of people wouldn\\'t want to use an additional cover.4) Some people commented that the cover added too much to the size and weight of the Kindle. ReallyRead more The Kindle is my first e-ink reader. I own an iPad, an iPhone, and have owned a Windows-based phone in the past that I used as an ereader.My overall impression of the device is good.The good:I\\'d honestly rather read linear (read from page one to the end, one page at a time) fiction from it than a book, because I can\\'t always get comfortable with a book. Hardcovers are sometimes a bit heavy, and paperbacks don\\'t always lie open easily. The Kindle is incredibly light and thin. I can hold it in one hand easily.

There are newer models: the basic, cheapie Kindle and the Kindle Touch, and of course the Kindle Fire quasi-tablet.Each of these models is an excellent choice. Whichever one is right for you just depends on your preferences.The 3 e-ink Kindles are Kindle Keyboard (this one), Kindle Touch (the newest flagship model), and the basic Kindle. All 3 of them have EXACTLY THE SAME 6 DISPLAY, with the same sharp typeface and high contrast that reads like ink on paper with no eyestrain. The Kindle Keyboard is the oldest of these models, and I got one of the first ones when they came out in August 2010.I still absolutely LOVE my Kindle Keyboard and use it almost every day. I have read dozens of books on it. I like the newer models, they have some neat features, but the experience of reading a book on them is no better or worse than on my 1-year-old Kindle Keyboard. Page turns are now smoother and faster on the newest Kindles, but the difference is not enough to make it worth the cost of upgrading, in my opinion.The touch-screen interface of the Kindle Touch is pretty neat. But, unlike my iPad, I only use my Kindle to read books, and reading books is just as nice on any of the current Kindle models. I don\\'t consider the touch screen a must have feature, and I\\'m normally obsessed with having the latest version of every tech product I own.For that reason, I think the cheapest Kindle is an excellent choice.Read more I\\'m a first-time Kindle owner, so I have nothing to compare the latest Kindle to.

I have an iPad and a Kindle DX, but I guess someone heard my complaints of them being too heavy and difficult to do extended-reading on. Don\\'t get me wrong, I absolutely love my iPad and DX, but this new generation of Kindle is perfect for reading outside and for long periods of time. The iPad gets completely washed out in sunlight and often irritates my eyes staring at it for more than a couple of hours. The DX was my go-to device for those extended/outdoor reading periods, but now I have a new friend for reading novels. Instead of a replacement, this one seems more like a companion to the other devices and is a different class. The iPad works great for web browsing, shopping, productivity, games, etc while the Kindle falls short in those areas. The Kindle works great for reading novels, where the iPad falls short. For those that love to do extended-reading of magazines, newspapers, research articles, etc, I find that the DX is the go-to device.Without a doubt, the size and weight of the new kindle is the biggest draw for me. It\\'s smaller than the last edition by a significant margin. I\\'ve played around with the Kindle 2 and was impressed, but now looking at the size of the new Kindle, I\\'m blown away. It\\'s the absolute perfect size. Smaller would be unmanageable and larger wouldn\\'t feel nearly as good. This is a device that you can hold up, read, and just forget that it\\'s there. Compared to other e-readers I\\'ve tried, it\\'s much smaller and much lighter.One of my biggest complaints about the previous generation Kindles and the DX is the speed.

All of them quit working. There\\'s absolutely no way to revive them once that battery loses power If NOT charged immediately, if even just a few weeks go by, NO HOPE of ever using your Kindle again. A major flaw I recently ordered my 8th Kindle. It was to replace my 7th Kindle which I unknowingly crushed. I love the Kindle Keyboard as my clumsy old hands tremble too much to type on a touch screen. For me, newer is just more frustrating. However, new Keyboard Kindles are scarce on the ground, so I got a reconditioned one. I noticed on my account page that Amazon recognized my new Kindle as soon as I bought it. When it arrived, however, it was not registered to me and it claimed it could not connect to my home WiFi. So I called my internet provider. I waded through that companys automated menu beginning with press 1 for English. That irritates me as I think English should be the default language in this country. But pressing on, I provided my 9 digit phone number, my 10 digit account number, my 9 digit zip code, my address, my 8 digit birthday, and the name of my favorite pet, my first car and my oldest nephew. Then I listened to an automated menu that had a 9 item selection none of which exactly fitted the problem I was having. After all this, I was asked if I would provide feedback after the call. I know this company and I was sure I would have comments to make, so I pressed 1 for yes. Then instead of finally letting me speak to a person, the automated voice directed me back through the forest of numbers I had already provided. Patiently I retyped all I had already typed. This time I was cannier. I refused the opportunity to give feedback and was finally connected to a person a person with a strong foreign accent and a bad phone connection. Didnt I press 1 for English After struggling for several minutes I begged for a supervisor as I could not understand the English spoken by this person. I was eventually routed to three other people with a hold time between each new connection as each person I spoke to did not handle my problem. I asked for phone numbers every time so I could reconnect if my call was disconnected accidentally. Finally I found a person who could help and did indeed get a connection established between my Kindle and my WiFi. I again asked for a telephone number in case I had further problems. Im sorry. I do not have a phone number that you can call to connect directly to me. Well, I should have known. I had been on the phone for 50 minutes.Then my Kindle would not download my archived items. So I contacted Amazons Help Line. I got an American in the first minute. I did not have to press anything I explained my problem. The Amazon American fiddled with a few buttons on his end and my Kindle began working correctly. I was on the phone for 4 minutes. Great. Love it. I researched the purchase of a Kindle for a long time. I couldn\\'t decide whether or not it was worth buying a dedicated e-reader. Boy am I glad I made this purchase. The downside to Amazon\\'s online selling of Kindle 3 is that the customers don\\'t get to see it in person. It is much better in person. This may sound stupid, but when I got my new Kindle, I thought there was a stuck-on overlay on the screen containing a diagram of the unit\\'s buttons, etc. I actually tried to peel it off. Doh! The e-ink on this unit is THAT good. I didn\\'t realize that I was staring at the actual display. I also didn\\'t realize that no power is required until the display changes. (thus the great battery life) I do a lot of reading, but was facing the prospect of reading less or buying large type books because of my variable and deteriorating eyesight. The new Kindle has been a godsend. Now, I can decide the size of type I need depending on my level of fatigue among other things. The weight and ergonomics are very good. For someone, like me, with neuropathy in his hands, it is extremely easy to manage and enjoyable to own. To me, it is easier to read than print books. The ease of navigation is great as is the speed. The battery life, so far, has been extraordinary. It easily connected to our home Wi-Fi, which by design does not broadcast an SSID. It downloads books so fast that I almost thought they were not completely received. I did not buy the 3G version because of the price difference and the fact that there is no coverage where I live. If you are not constantly traveling, I don\\'t see the need to spend the extra bucks, but that is a matter of personal choice. For those who have no Wi-Fi at home, remember that you can always download the material to your computer and transfer it via USB.Read more This thing has captured my wife\\'s heart. She reads every where, all the time. Vacation, on the way to church, At bedtime and far beyond. Books are so easy to get from the kindle itself It fits in her purse, I have to repeat everything , I always get, right after this chapter . Do not buy this for someone you want share LIFE with. I got my Kindle a few years ago and barely used it. Recently I discovered it again and have been using it daily, always in a hard protective case as it has been from day 1. Yesterday I opened the cover ready to read and discovered the screen had apparently cracked, seemingly for no apparent reason (no extreme temperatures, dropping, pressure, etc.). A quick Google search revealed this is a common problem, especially for my model, which made me think Amazon would replace the device for me due to the obvious design flaw. Not a chance though. Despite endless reports of this problem popping up through simple internet searches the representative I spoke to denied this was a common problem and was only able to offer me a very slight discount on a new product. Not sure it is worth the investment again - thinking it is better to stick to reading on my iPad, which is equipped with indestructible Gorilla Glass. Bottom line: do not buy a Kindle if you want a lasting product It was excellent for me in one moment when I was able to use it onboard cruise ship while ship was in international water with it\\'s own 3G or EDGE cellphone network. Once they stop this way of using around 5 months ago, now I can use it only when I am in the states. Bought for my husband for Christmas and I have to admit that I use it much more than he does, I love this product even though it has been updated with newer versions. I like to have something with just books. Easy to use, screen is easy to read, battery life long. I use it at the beach and for travel. Nice to have It simply works even after 3.5 years of constant use. The battery is OK. Display looks the same. System is stable and reasonably responsive. I would highly recommend them to everyone. Got it when I was told that I would get it. Very happy. Through all of my research this was the best value for what I was looking for in an e-reader with additional options I was not sure I would use or not. Turns I do because of the ease of usage. Pretty decent tablet. Good for mindless games and Netflix. You get what you pay for. Much more memory that my prior kindles. Luv that I can add a sd card for extra storage good quality, low cost compare to iPad, i like this. I was going to have to be face down after eye surgery recently and decided to get a tablet to be able to look at the internet and movies on something other than my phone. While there are ones which have more features (and better software), the Fire HD8 had a good price and was available. It had gotten good reviews, and it performs well, with great battery life. If you\\'re looking for a good, basic tablet, this is a nice option. I love the tablets HD picture is beautiful. The fire tablet is very fast to load and is easy to use. Great tablet. This is very nice for a little over 100.00 dollars. It took a bit to get use to after using a iPad. I got this to travel with or take to the beach nice size very lightweight. I couldn\\'t get the tablet to work with my WiFi so I returned it and bought a Samsung A-8. This tablet is small, compact and easy to handle. It\\'s easy to figure out the main functions. My one complaint is that it does not support some big apps such as Dropbox or Google Drive. I\\'m a Windows person & this is not Windows. I\\'m still learning. I am happy with the size as it fits easily in to my purse, but I HATE touch items - I always seem to touch the wrong area (like spelling something, I go for a letter & get one of the letters next to - so it slows down my typing - one of the reasons I don\\'t have a smartphone). All in all it\\'s pretty good. I guess I would recommend it because it\\'s the way this world is turning. However, they don\\'t make a glass protective screen cover - only plastic. Ordered for my daughter to replace an older version and she loves it. Larger screen and colored case are a big plus. I have not set up tablet, geeks squad to do so Monday April 3 2017 Have been using this for a while and never believe it would be so handy and helpful. Product features are good and is quite handy to carry anywhere. I love the internet, tweeting and facebook. No computers can complete me!! My kindle takes care of all my needs ;) !!!Juju I like it. It keeps my granddaughter business and great apps too. She loves it, the only problem I have is getting it away from her, even while riding in vehicles. LOL I bought this because I have ebooks in college. Not only could I not get my ebook. I called the school IT department. They could not either. My semester was already started. The sales representative at the store told me this is what I needed. I ended up buying a tablet from my phone carrier and my ebooks were right there in less than 5 minutes with the schools IT department help. Wife really likes it. Works great& likes the front & back camera. I bought this kindle for my 11yr old granddaughter for Christmas. Me and my husband both had kindles several years prior, and she and my 6 year old grandson love watching and playing on them. Both children have all kinds of game systems but use the kindle way more. My 6 yr old grandson still plays with mine and loves watching you tube, videos and playing games on it. He has several game systems, Xbox, sega, ds but still uses my kindle all the time over those systems.my husband used his all the time for everything from internet to watching movies and shows. I\\'m getting ready to buy my grandson a new kindle( mine is a bit older and has cracked screen now but still works good).He would like one to call his own. I\\'m looking at a 16 GB or 32 GB.they are really durable and tough. This is my first Fire Kindle. I love it. It is fast, and has good internet. It gives me quick access to all my Kindle library. I found out it\\'s easier to scroll through the pages than when using Kindle Touch. Fast on internet, easy connection. Easy to use. Clear display. Was looking at iPad mini. After reading reviews of both Kindle fire and iPad I bought the Kindle for so much less $$$ And I don\\'t have to put up the Apple\\'s native apps etc. Thanks. We really like this tablet . It\\'s easy to use All I wanted was a Kindle to read books. I got this instead!! Excellent choice because I can read books and do so much more!! I had to return this product as it was not compatible with things such as Facebook and Itunes... which is what I needed it for. Great if you are into books and streaming movies! Love this Kindle. There are to many apps and games offered for download. Love the book selection Easy to navigate The charger seems a bit loose, though I like the ease of use and good support from Amazon. A reasonable price for a versatile tablet. This tablet is excellent considering the price. It has a very clear display, is a fairly large tablet, and has plenty of memory to store a lot of apps, music, pictures and more. Considering the price, this tablet has the best value out of all tablets to date in my opinion. I\\'ve had lots of tablets in the past, mostly from the Samsung line, but this is my first Amazon Fire, so I want to write this review for others who have never tried one of these. At the time that this was written, Alexa had not been added to the tablet.First, while this device runs an Android type of operating system, Amazon puts its own spin on the operating system. I don\\'t feel like I\\'m using Android. This feels different to me. It doesn\\'t have the same level of customization that Android users have come to appreciate. That being said, if you are an Amazon Prime member, this device has been tailored to be your content entertainment machine. It\\'s simply a fun way to consume your magazines, books, etc.There are 3 on-screen buttons on the bottom of the device. The middle button immediately takes you to your home screen. The button to the left acts as a sort of \"back\" button. It also lets me get rid of my keyboard when I don\\'t need it on screen, but it\\'s open. The button to the right is super important. It took me a couple of days to realize what it does. That square shaped button is what you press you see what apps you have open. It lets you switch between apps, but it also lets you see which apps you have open and close them out. You can close them by pressing the \"X\" button in the corner of the window that appears or by touching the app window and swiping to the right. If you leave all of those apps open and you never close them, you\\'ll drain your battery. Make sure you use that little square button to clear your apps.The device has several menus that you swipe left to view. First, you start with your home screen. You literally can stay on this screen and do anything you need to do on the tablet. All of your apps are housed here. You swipe up to view all of them. The tablet comes with several apps pre-installed such as Slik, Amazon\\'s own internet browser, Audible, Good Reads, the Amazon app store, a weather app, etc. You can go to the Amazon app store to download other apps such as Twitter, Facebook, etc. You can combine the apps on this page into folders. You just drag one app to another app and a folder appears. This made my home screen much more manageable. You can change the size of the font on the home screen from normal to large or small in the device settings. This feature doesn\\'t necessarily increase the size of the font within your apps, however. I believe it only changes the font on your main screens.If you have a magazine or newspaper subscription that is connected to your device, when you have a new issues, it will show up at the top of your home page screen under the heading of \"new items.\" The device comes with a free 6 month subscription to the Washington Post. You\\'ll see that under \"new items\" when you initially activate your tablet.You can change the wallpaper on the screen to use one of your own photos. You can do this through the settings menu on the device. If you want to use one of your own photos, however, you need to either take it on the device or move it into Amazon\\'s Photos app, which is a cloud-based app.So far, I haven\\'t found a way to effectively use a different photo management app that will let me change my wallpaper. I\\'m not crazy about the Amazon Photo app. I found it annoying to move my photos from my phone into Amazon\\'s cloud just so I could view them on my tablet. That being said, I\\'m not planning to take photos on this device. I just wanted a few pet photos on there and the ability to change my wallpaper.Beyond the home screen, you can swipe to the right to view your other screen. They are pre-arranged to be: books, videos, games, shop, apps, music, audiobooks, and newstand. All of those screens are connected to your Amazon account. For example, if you have Kindle books you\\'ve already purchased, they automatically will appear under the Books menu. Your magazines and newspaper subscriptions will appear under the newstand menu. There doesn\\'t seem to be a way to change the order of the menu pages. That bugs me, but it\\'s not the end of the world. There\\'s also one menu to the left of the \"home\" menu. It\\'s the \"recent\" page. It shows you what you\\'ve received looked at on the tablet. I never use it, but it might be handy for some people.One of my favorite features of this tablet is Amazon\\'s \"On Deck\" capability. If you\\'re an Amazon Prime member, Amazon will periodically download a video to your device that it thinks you might like. The items don\\'t count against your pre-installed memory and they automatically deleted off if your memory starts getting full. You can turn off the \"on deck\" feature if you don\\'t like it. I\\'ve been content with the video playback capability. This isn\\'t my major use of the device, but the images look fine and the audio is OK. I\\'ll talk more about the speakers later. My other favorite feature of this tablet is viewing magazine content through the Newstand. I\\'ve tried 3 magazines on here and they all look gorgeous. Now, I can always have my magazines with me so if I\\'m stuck at the airport or at the doctor\\'s office, I always have them. One of my regular magazines includes a free digital version of the magazine for free. I just had to connect my account to the device. This allows me to download the back issues of the magazine for as long as I\\'ve had an account. My other magazine didn\\'t include a digital edition so I canceled the print edition of it and switched to the digital version. (It was an inexpensive magazine, anyway.) There are several magazines that you can try free for 30 days on the device. I did this with a third magazine and decided to keep it for a year. Viewing magazines on this gadget is a pleasure.The Kindle Fire doesn\\'t come with the Google Play store installed. You can side load it to the device without rooting it (and breaking your warranty.) You can Google to find the instructions to do this. It\\'s not difficult to do if you\\'re fairly comfortable with technology. It probably took me 10 minutes. Most of the apps I wanted were in the Amazon store, but there were a handful that I had paid for through Google Play. The only way I could have them was to go back to access that store. They have worked fine so far. I despise the keyboard that Amazon pre-installed on this device. There are no lines between the letters on the keyboard. I suppose it designed to be better for swyping through keys, but I hate it. I fixed that problem by going to Google Play and downloading a new keyboard. It was a pretty easy problem to solve so I can\\'t complain.Apps that are connecting to the Internet can be a little slow to load on this device compared to my other gadgets, but that generally doesn\\'t bother me. If you were using this tablet to replace your personal laptop, however, that might drive you crazy. The screen on this device isn\\'t bad. If I compare it to my fancy phone, it\\'s not as shape, but when you think about the price of this device compared to my smartphone, the screen is outstanding.The speakers are OK. There are two of them located on the bottom of the screen. I won\\'t say that they are fantastic. They aren\\'t. In my opinion, they are fine for watching YouTube or a television show. They are not OK for listening to music if you are an audiophile. You can make it a little better by downloading a different music app instead of relying on the pre-install app, but still your music will sound tinny. That being said, you can always connect your tablet to a bluetooth speaker, use a pair of headphones, etc.This device wasn\\'t made for taking pictures. It has a front and back camera, but they aren\\'t designed to be spectacular. I\\'m not using them.I find this device a little difficult to hold in my hands. I think that\\'s partly because of the size and partly because it feels very slick. Also, I do have some hand problems (similar to someone who has Carpal Tunnel syndrome). I think it will be easier to handle once my case arrives. I\\'m still waiting for it. I\\'m greatly enjoying this device. It\\'s simply fun to use the tablet. There are weaknesses that come with that lower price tag, but you legitimately get a lot of bang for your buck, particularly if you regularly use Amazon services. If you don\\'t typically use Amazon and you are just looking for a tablet for viewing the Internet and you\\'re looking for a low price tag, this device may be OK for you. I bought this to replace a damaged much more expensive tablet of my daughters. Great item and just as nice as the more expensive one. She absolutely loves it. Fantastic tablet fire one is great. Small and portable I purchased this product with an eye on simply trying out a tablet. It has become a product I use every day. You have to get used to the Amazon app store, which is different than the Google Play store, though it is still android-based. The tablet is fast and the user experience is satisfying. I purchased the 32Gb. model for the extra storage space. It is a great tablet for under $100! Decent little tablet if you are not a game player. Tablet shuts down and I cant get it back on when I play games for long periods of time. It\\'s not my ipad, that\\'s for sure. Does a lot more than old tablet.It Hasmore memory. Excellent value, lets me lug all my favorite books around and read whenever. Wouldn\\'t be without it. I love my Amazon Fire HD 8. It\\'s not too small and not too big. I was looking at other tablets, and decided on the Amazon Fire HD 8 because of the price, and because I have Amazon Prime, I purchased it online at Best Buy, and then picked it up at the store on Black Friday. It is my first tablet, and so I wanted to start with one that I can have fun with, and I am. I do have a laptop for important things. I have put off buying a tablet because all the ipads I tried with friends were hypersensitive making it difficult for me to navigate easily. This one is the bomb - I am 68 and not a techie but quite intelligent - this Kindle Fire is a perfect fit for me and does everything I want it to do and more with great speed and wonderful resolution. I am new at tablets and look forward to enjoying learning all that this Kindle Fire will provide for me - so far each step has been a breeze. I just love it. my daughter just loved this kindle fire. she said it was the perfect gift that she could receive. I love my kindle fire. Its a great reading device. Easy to set up, great picture love it! Keeps my kids entertained and they love it also ....it was a gift. The last 2 models of Kindle HDX 8 have been terrible. We have purchased 2 of each model of Kindle and up until the last 2 models, they have been great. Last years had to be replaced 7 or 8 times and for the same problem. The slot for the SD card is defective. I gave up and bought the newest model. It shuts completely down if you try to plug it in to external speakers and sometimes it shuts down for no reason. It\\'s going back after the first of the year. This is going to be my last year for Kindles unless they make them the same quality as before. Phooey! Easy to use with great picture. I would recommend it to a friend. This product was purchased for my Grandson. He had a fire 6. He however loves the HD 8. He uses it for music & gaming mostly. Great electronic device. This works great. I read a LOT and I needed something that would handle all my eBooks. It has all the other bells and whistles as any tablet but I use it for the eBooks and one game. Excellent! So far the tablet has been working without any issues. Haven\\'t used it enough to rate it any higher but time will tell. This is the right device to play with puzzles, you can avoid samsung/verizon constant advertisements. Only wish the battery would last longer or charge faster. My Fire is compact and easy to use. Mainly used to read online books at lunch time. The battery lasts much longer than previous tablet I had and charges much quicker. very happy with my Fire. Used it for watching television shows. The picture was clear and the audio was decent for the location of the speakers. great kid friendly product, hours of enjoyment for all. Only negative is the apps. Thought they were from android but they\\'re an Amazon version and limited. I have really enjoyed my new kindle and the ability to take pictures. It stays charged a long time when I am reading a book or watching a movie. I just wish that kindles could run on an LTE network as well when you do not have a WiFi signal. The clarity of the screen and the back-lit text makes this an improvement from my old tablet. I now can read this in low light and enjoy the color as well. I am enjoying my new Kindle, but it did present some challenges in its set up. I would recommend getting help in the store to get you started. I have had this for several weeks. It works great. I am very satisfied with it so far. This is my 3rd Kindle upgrade. I love everything about it. The ebooks read to me at night, the games and the movies show extremely well...feels as though I am right there. My kids have ipads...but I\\'m stuck on my Kindle. Never without my Amazon HD 8 - great for reading, games and surfing the networks. Awesome and best e-book reader. I love the smooth page translations, bedtime shade and perfect hand held device. Kindle Fire has took their e reader to the next level. Great apps, music, and storage expansion for the price. Bought this for a work fundraiser and the recipient enjoyed it I think this is a great product and I would recommend it. it was a good deal for this unit. they even beat amazon.... Bought it for the grandkids for Christmas. Like the parental controls! Haven\\'t had this long but so far so good. It\\'s nice when you buy a product and it works exactly how it is supposed to. I bought this for a daughter, who would be taking this to school for BYOD. It\\'s perfect size table offers, loads of amazon goodies if you are prime member. For our need, it was good enough, but one of the requirement was to have Google App support on this. Since this runs Fire OS, it\\'s everything Amazon proprietary. There as \"howto\" on web on getting google play store and its app on this, but the integration with the device lacks upon those \"fixes\" from the articles on how to get Google app store working on this tablet. Since it would not be useful for her in school because of requirements for Google apps, we\\'re returning it. Otherwise, Great tablet, but Fire OS restricts Google Apps. Bought this for my adult son who had a long flight and he absolutely loved it! Definitely recommend! So easy to use and navigate. Easy easy Amazon downloads from books to apps etc. I\\'m in the older generation that finds it hard to navigate electronics but not this tablet and Best Buy employees were great in helping me decide by giving a tutorial and info on the tablet . Fast, fluid, and lots of apps especially once I added the google play store(very simple to do and doesn\\'t require anything that voids the warranty). Display is sharp and video and games load quickly. I deducted one star as Amazon\\'s version of android lacks the ability of customization. For the price this is an excellent tablet. I have a high end laptop that does convert to tablet but at almost 16\" and the foldover design I normally just use it in laptop mode. I also have a high end \"phablet\" sized phone. So I was not sure how often I\\'d use a tablet, and did not want to spend 500ish on an ipad. The Fire has been a great \"in between\" so far on days I use my phone alot and want to avoid charging more than once per day, and don\\'t have the need to use my laptop. The speed is zippy & the screen clarity/quality is good enough. Storage is even better than ipads since it is expandable (for now I use a 64 gb card giving me a total of 96 gb, but the expandable can go up to 200 gb). Tying into Amazon is nice since I have Amazon Prime). Basic web surfing, email & facebook work great. The only \"bad\" feature is the camera & video quality. But that does not matter to me since I have my high quality camera & video recorder on my phone. Only other slight negative is light bleed noticed just when booting up on grey screen. Color/brightness uniformity is perfect to my eyes once it is up & running. Really enjoying the kindle component for book & magazine reading as well. Overall, probably the best $100 I have spent in a long time. Larger size more.memory, better price great product and wonderful service Many improvements than the older model with an excellent screen and great battery life. Great for all your tablet needs! Email, video, games, and reading! All in one!! My husband loves this. He is happy that he can read anything he chooses from his library and that he also has WiFi access to get to his email and the internet whenever he wants. I was literally still using my first gen Kindle Fire and finally upgraded. I love the new one. The only negative is the speakers. My first one is louder than this one. I have one, purchased this one for my mother in law, she had a 7 inch, between the bigger screen and HD, this one is much easier on her eyes and she can use it for longer periods of time without her eyes bothering her. But, I can\\'t figure out how to move books I\\'ve read, into the Cloud? I don\\'t like clutter, and the more I read and download, just clogs up. It\\'s great to some extent but I was expecting more. It\\'s unfortunate that it does not work with lots of apps. Perhaps I\\'m not using them correctly. I\\'m still learning. Bought as gift for my granddaughter who is 10. She loves it. Plays games, watches videos and listens to music. GREAT MEMORY,GREAT MOVIES,GREAT READING, GREAT GAMES,DO I HAVE TO SAY MORE This is the third Fire tablet I have bought. The larger size is nice. I don\\'t know much about tablets but the sales associate recommended this one for me. It does what I need and more but I just don\\'t know how to use it yet. I talk myself into the 32g and I am so glad I did!!! I have used only kindles for the past 5 years and I love them.... I love the color as well!!! The kindle over all is great. There\\'s only one thing I would want better and that is the speaker. My last kindle was louder. I really miss the louder speaker. I bought this as a Christmas gift for my wife and things started out well but lately my wife has been having issues with it. It hasn\\'t been working as it should and its only been a little over 2 months since she\\'s had it. I\\'m going to try a hard reset on it and see if that helps. Purchased this as a gift for my wife because her B&N Nook was dying. She absolutely loves it, especially since it does so much more. I\\'m now waiting for my Nook to start acting up so that I have an excuse to get a Kindle for myself. I would recommend anyone buy this product., just awesome. Love my new Kindle fire. This replaces my old one and is just as good. Videos are as good as my tv with cable. Well with every penny spent and better deal than when I tried Amazon. We replaced and aging fire HDX. She noticed the WiFi connection is improved and the screen is larger. She prefers this to my iPad Air Nice little tablet with great features. Bought one for my mom so she can read without all the weight of a big book. She also loves the nice backlight so she can be on her tablet at night without the lights on. Wanted something with a kids mode on it so we could limit time and content. This works. Saw it for a really low price so couldn\\'t resist otherwise we would have gotten the padded kids version. I was looking to upgrade from my old Kindle reader and stumbled on the Fire HD which is not only a reader but a tablet as well. Fairly easy to use. I really only needed to read books but how have a tablet as well. I wish it supported all google play apps and not just Amazon apps but I can check email and get to the web so it serves the purpose. But...when I want to read in the middle of the night, getting to the web can be distracting. In my opinion it\\'s very slow for internet use. Good for our 5 yr old to use but we purchased this for her to do online curriculums, which is almost impossible to do with this tablet because of the speed. Our internet connection is great with every other laptop and computer in the house. easy to use. nice sides and easy to read ,, also very easy to load Had a prob with original one I purchased and Bedt Buy replaced it hassle free I would recommend the Fire Tablet to anyone. IT is very easy to set up, download apps and use. Movies are crisp and clear. Bought this mostly as a backup.and to read a few books, since I have a larger cell phone and a back up. Used it occasionally may 40 or 50 hours of use till this week when I sent my laptop in for repairs. so I probably used it a tot this week. I was watching my 3rd Primetime video this week and it simply turned off. It will not turn on using any power trick such as safe mode. It is gone, It is toast. Bought it October 11, 2016 , It quit on February 9, 2015. My old Fire lasted 4 or 5 years with more use. it had stereo speakers, lasted a week on a charge not 2 or 3 days.Sturdier built. This is full of junk, I am not just offered more apps, it is constantly trying to add them. JUNK JUNK JUNK This is a very good tablet. The only con is you may have to reboot it too often. I hate amazon app store. Nothing good in there. The tablet is too slow for what I do... it is good for reading only.... This is my second Fire. Wanted a larger size to make eBooks easier to read. Very pleased with the size and clarity of this tablet. Easy to take along in a tote. Perfect for what I wanted it for.'"

       "'This product so far has not disappointed. My children love to use it and I like the ability to monitor control what content they see with ease. great for beginner or experienced person. Bought as a gift and she loves it Inexpensive tablet for him to use and learn on, step up from the NABI. He was thrilled with it, learn how to Skype on it already... I\\'ve had my Fire HD 8 two weeks now and I love it. This tablet is a great value.We are Prime Members and that is where this tablet SHINES. I love being able to easily access all of the Prime content as well as movies you can download and watch laterThis has a 1280/800 screen which has some really nice look to it its nice and crisp and very bright infact it is brighter then the ipad pro costing $900 base model. The build on this fire is INSANELY AWESOME running at only 7.7mm thick and the smooth glossy feel on the back it is really amazing to hold its like the futuristic tab in ur hands. I bought this for my grand daughter when she comes over to visit. I set it up with her as the user, entered her age and name and now Amazon makes sure that she only accesses sites and content that are appropriate to her age. Simple to do and she loves the capabilities. I also bought and installed a 64gig SD card which gives this little tablet plenty of storage. For the price I think this tablet is best one out there. You can spend hundreds of dollars more for additional speed and capacity but when it comes to the basics this tablets does everything that most people will ever need at a fraction of the cost. This amazon fire 8 inch tablet is the perfect size. I purchased it for my husband so that he has a bigger screen than just his phone. He had gotten me one a few years ago so I knew it would be a good purchase. Great for e-reading on the go, nice and light weight, and for the price point given, definitely worth the purchase. I gave this as a Christmas gift to my inlaws, husband and uncle. They loved it and how easy they are to use with fantastic features! Great as a device to read books. I like that it links with my borrowed library e-books. Switched from another popular tablet brand and I am happy with the choice I made. It took some time to get books from my previous non-Kindle reader, but finally figured out a way! I love ordering books and reading them with the reader. Not easy for elderly users cease of ads that pop up. Excellent product. Easy to use, large screen makes watching movies and reading easier. Wanted my father to have his first tablet and this is a very good value. He can watch movies and play a few games. Easy enough for him to use. Simply does everything I need. Thank youAnd silk works wonders Got it as a present and love the size of the screen The kindle is easiest to use, graphics and screen crisp, clear, brilliant colors. nice reader. almost perfect for what i want/need. good bargain I really like this tablet. I would have given 5 stars but sometimes you have to push start several times after you unlock the screen and it is a little annoying. Great video quality lots of fun apps fun for the whole family Love love love my kindle fire 8.....this is what my 9 yr old granddaughter said when I bought this for her at Christmas..we have purchased kindled in the past but this one has been the best....love the fact that you can now use a memory card in it...that helps so much when you use it for books...games...music and viedos...thanks Excellent tablet with nice screen. I wish Amazon would pre install the play store, this would have been perfect. Preloaded with the reading app from Kindle but expandable with other apps. Perfect for travel. Carry your library, games and productivity apps in a small footprint. Very happy with this product and easy to use..picture is clear, takes great pictures.. My grandchildren are home schooled and utilize the tables for many learning apps! They LOVE using them as it makes them feel \"so grown up\"! The tablets are a great leaning tool and they are receiving many benefits from them! Great size, easy to carry for traveling. Need to spend more time Looking into apps for contact manegement, interactive calenders and most important, music storage and use. I purchased this when my last tablet died. It meets all basic needs and the price was great. Perfect for downloading and reading books !! Perfect size and has a nice, bright screen. I was surprised when I learned of the capabilities of this device. Now my husband has more access to his desktop and I am doing things which I couldn\\'t on his device. I got it for my son. Its user friendly and durable. The visual quality on the Fire 8 HD is amazing. It runs very fast and is easy to use, very durable. If your looking for a affordable gift this is it!. This is a great tablet for the price, would recommend it to anyone looking for a basic tablet. Works great. Love the portability of books. Overall great product I am still learning all the things I can do with my new Kindle Fire. It is so much better (lighter in weight and easier to use) than my old tablet. Just the right size for reading books and playing some games. I love everything about this tablet! The imaging is sharp and clear. It\\'s fast and light weight. Love it! Overall a nice product for traveling purposes Value for money My children love this table great quality of pictures, excellent camera I bought 3 tablets and my family was not disappointed. Great tablet fast screen good size never gives me problem Bought this for my 87 year old grandmother who wanted to be able to play games and read books from the library. My aunt lives with her and can help her use it so its perfect for that type of user. After playing with It, I would consider it for just about anyone other than a hardcore user that wants the latest and greatest tech. if you are tech saavy, you can do more with these Fire tablets than advertised. This is exactly what the person wanted as a gift and she enjoys using it. Does all basic functions of a tablet. Hardcore users may want an iPad. Works great for a simple tablet. Not a huge fan of the silk browser but it could be worse! I am very happy with my purchase! It\\'s fast and easy to use. This is my second kindle fire . More flexibility than a Kindle and bigger screen. Like it because I can surf the web and download and read books. For the money you cannot beat this tablet. Full of features, picture quality is great, and very fast speed while using the internet. Easy to use, solid build, sharp HP screen for movies. Who needs more? Tablet is perfect for beginners who just want basic this is my first tablet .. love it .. actually read my first e-book on it .. large screen, easy to read & play games .. fits nicely in my purse This 8 inch Fire is definitely better than the cheaper 7 inch. It works fine enough for teens to play games and watch movies. Great tablet for under $100. Does not have the highest specs, but gets the job done for lite tablet users. I purchased the kindle fire because I needed a entertainment only device for long flights. This device is the perfect size for travel and easy to use and set up with your Amazon account. It is worth purchasing a Fire tablet if you are an Amazon Prime member. If not, I would not recommend it because the available apps are limited . My only complaint about this device is that if it freezes it is difficult to reset. This fire tablet has long battery life. Reasonable fast Got this for my wife and she loves it. She had the previous generation and this one is a giant keep forward. Sleek packaging easy set up and great for anyone who wants a e reader with more to offer. Best and most affordable option of all the Kindle devices available. I did not want to get a new kindle but my old one would not charge or show a charge anymore. I could not depend on it for any length of time so I finally broke down and bought a new one. I am very happy with this one. I was afraid I would lose my music and photos since not all came from the Amazon store. However, everything I had on the old kindle transferred to the new one. I am still learning all about it but so far so good. My daughter likes this tablet to play her online games! Easy to figure out and used it extensively on my vacation. Excellent tablet to leave at my easel and display reference photos. It\\'s light enough to velcro to a articulating stand (so I can position the tablet right next to my canvas). It\\'s cheap enough to not worry about. I love it, for the price. I bought this wanting for books comics and movies and it has not disappoint ever since My 4 year old Grandson loves his Kindle. He had to have one after his sister got one. Easy to use. As a beginner I found this pad very good. Enjoy the kindle app. This Kindle does what I need it to do. The camera could be better but overall I am pretty happy with my purchase. Purchased this for my daughter to do more reading. It has so much more options for her if she wants. this is a great tablet for the price. my kid loves it ,does alot reading on it. I was really hoping that this would be faster than some other inexspensive tablets I\\'ve had. I mainly use it for email though and it does the job. Bought as a Christmas gift for someone. I bought iPad as well. Will update when it\\'s used. Great tablet for the price. It is easy to navigate. I believe that this will be very useful during my husbands recovery from foot surgery. This is something that is useful if your looking for something to take along trips This is a wonderful device. I love the extra capabilities and apps. Decent tablet. Access to kindle and pretty much all your google apps. I am very happy with this tablet. The worst thing is that my steals it all the time. Lol A family member has vision problems. They had seen/used the Kindle of another family member - especially the ability to scale text. This device will make it possible to read, which she has had extreme difficulty doing. Easy setup and connect to WIFI. Great viewing area. Easy to read in bright places. I got this fire for my friend who wants to buy kindle..this serves both Kindle and Tab... very nice and very cheap..worth for what i paid.. I highly recommend this for beginners Really enjoyed the price value of this tablet versus ipad Amazing tablet with fast processor. It looks great... got good deal We got this for our 5 year old and this is really great for the price. Works like a charm!! I find it easy to use, but the kindle does not come with instructions, so you have to find your way around. I bought this because I was tired of watching Youtube and Twitch on my phone. Excellent display sound is decent-not great but you can always buy a speaker. The negatives are-it is definitely a fingerprint magnet, and the Spectrum TV app is AWFUL-the app works fine on my phone, but for some reason on this tablet it freezes and is unusable. All things considered, for 65 bucks it\\'s hard to be beat. I love this tablet. The battery life last a long time. I use my Amazon Kindle Fire predominately for watching movies on Amazon Prime, Netflix\\'s, and checking my emails. I also carry it to my appointments and meetings. It is a compact tablet, and not big and bulky. The playback of the movies are great, and the movies are HD. Great little tablet if you are looking for something to watch movies and checking emails. I would definitely recommend this tablet to friends and family members. My daughter loves this kindle, she does so much with it,well worth the money. Was looking for a tablet that was highly portable & could run my DIRECTTV app & stream videos. (Other electronics I have are much older versions). Salesman recommended this model to me based on personal experience. I am still learning all its functions but so far it seems easy to use & is doing what it promised to do. This is my second Fire, the other one is now retired. I like having HD. Works just fine. My wife bought this for me for my birthday. I enjoy reading biographys which usually have color photos. The regular Kindle make the pics black and white or they\\'re aren\\'t any. This allows me to see the color photos. I also love the night feature when I\\'m in bed reading. I no longer need a light on to read or need to hold a large book. Thanks to a knowledgeable, low-pressure salesperson, I was ready to buy my first tablet. This one was the right price (on sale) and I have not been disappointed. Every few days I learn more ways to use it besides checking e-mails & checking out library books & audio books. It stays charged for days, even with regular use. I recommend it as an inexpensive and very satisfactory alternative to more expensive tablets. It\\'s a great tablet for the price. Don\\'t expect it to be as fast more expensive ones. It\\'s meant for casual use and it does a great job at that. For the price, you can\\'t beat it. Get a nice large microsd card and you don\\'t have to worry about space. It runs a little slow on certain things if you are multitasking but it\\'s a simple tablet. I\\'ve run plenty of 720p videos without fail. It\\'s great for ebooks or other files. Some more elaborate pdfs take a while to load if they have a lol of graphics. Battery life seems good for a small table too.The only real Issue I have is the Amazon App store being limited. It is an offshoot of Android but not all the same apps are available. There is a way around it but I wish they would just allow it access to Google Play or at least offer the same apps.So, it\\'s a nice inexpensive table that works great. For the money, you will love it but don\\'t get upset that is doesn\\'t run as fast as a $500 tablet. That\\'s not its job. Bought it for my 10 yr old granddaughter. Does everything she wants it to do in a tablet. Very easy to use tablet. Lots of apps and game available. We love the FreeTime settings for kids on the newer Kindle Fires. I was able to create a login for each of our kids as well as myself and set limits to the amount of device time they are allowed daily (can set to more for weekends if desired). You can set the age restrictions for content also, to avoid inappropriate ads, etc. Once you\\'ve downloaded apps, you can choose which ones you want each child to have access to in their profile settings, so if one child is older you can allow them access to something their younger siblings shouldn\\'t have. Basically, I like that I can set their access rights and know they\\'re safe so I don\\'t have to continually monitor every moment. By the way, FreeTime kids settings are available without having to subscribe to their FreeTime app access plan. :) Great tablet, very clear picture. Would buy again. Good reader which is why I bought it. Ads are annoying. It\\'s a mini computer packed in a handheld devise. Applications load quickly and I am able to get my work completed, while riding the commuter rail. Nice for a smaller tablet. It\\'s good for Internet surfing. Purchased as a door prize gift given with a one year Amazon membership. The recipient loves it and says it performs very well. (As a past Amazon Fire user, now i-Pad graduate, I loved my Amazon Fire for more than 4 years without any problems. In fact, I just recycled it on to my son and it runs like a champ). I have 4 other kinds of tables. This the best I have had. I can listen to music, read a book, listen to a book, or watch movies/tv shows. Great product for the kids gaming apps parental controls to make sure you can monitor kids and prevent unwanted app purchases I purchased 2 of these tablets for my 6 and 8 year old. They were a Black Friday special for $59. They are perfect for the apps and games they wanted. Great product. Love the Amazon ecosystem. The Freetime subscription is a must Needed something a bit larger than the 6+ to stream Netflix, this was perfect! my husband bought this for me as a Christmas present. I couldn\\'t understand why he bought it because I already have a Kindle Fire.Once I opened it and got it going, I loved all it could do plus the graphic is so much colorful than my older Kindle. my grandson-8-loves this --the games and the books! Great product and I\\'m very satisfied with it. I recommend it to other people. I purchased this tablet for my niece for Christmas and she love it. Easy to use, responds quickly, great screen brightness. Great tablet but apps limited comparison of other tablets. Works as we thought it should. NO PROBLEMS. Good buying experience. We have the smaller one, and been great. This one is even better, because of the size. I am a prime member & I love this tablet. Very user friendly especially if you are a prime member with amazon. Not real tech savvy so I need all the help I can get to keep things simple & automatic. Great clarity of picture/data. Have a 10\" tablet and wasn\\'t sure about downgrading size (old eyes) but was delighted to see it works fine at 8\" instead of 10\". Also, easier to take around in the smaller size. Highly recommend especially if you subscribe to Amazon and are a prime member. Great benefits!! Got this for my wife. She loves the bigger screen and the better app management features that this one has over her earlier generation kindle. Definitely worth it! Connects to home WiFi automatically. Many books, and many games. Actually functions like a computer tablet. E-mail is a breeze. Bought this to replace no-name budget tablet for my daughter. She loves this as it is much faster and has a better display than her old tablet. This is a wonderful value as it is faster, has a better display and sound, is a name brand and cost about the same ... what\\'s not to love about this product? She loves this tablet. It works well unlike her \"bargain\" tablet which she tried to use previously and cost about the same. She likes the sound of it also! She enjoys the free games she downloaded and navigates the wev easily with it. It\\'s no iPad, but it\\'s great for Netflix and some app games. I\\'m not worried about the kids getting their paws on it since it\\'s relatively inexpensive. Didn\\'t have some of the features I was looking for. Returned it the next day. May be good for others I bought this for my daughter and she loves it. It\\'s speedy when loading books! Purchased for my wife who reads a lot and truly enjoys the amazon fire. A great Christmas gift, the kids love the gifts... Daughter got this as a present. It was easy to set up and display is great. Features allow us to limit her time on games, web, etc. while allowing her unlimited time to read I have enjoyed just learning how to use it. You\\'re never too old to learn new things. bought for husband and he was surprised it does the work he needs it for This was a birthday present and it was ideal for a traveler to read ebooks on while on the rood My teenage daughter enjoyed her three year old 7\" Kindle for recreation but wanted a larger screen for word processing. Paired this with a Bluetooth keyboard and she was thrilled. i Bought this around black friday for $60 hoping it would be awesome... it failed so hard i tried multiple different micro SD cards none of which were recognized and YES i formated them with every format i could think of ... Fat32, NTFS, Fat, Xfat... i even tried to have the tablet do it... didnt work... to make matters worse half the apps i wanted to use werent in the app store and i came to find out that it isnt linked to the normal google play store this tablet has its own app store which is missing many common apps... the main reason i bought this was to play clash of clans and i cant because it wasnt on the app store... i tried to also use aftermarket play stores to play COC but it didnt work... launched and played 1 time but didnt work or update after that... needless to say i returned it and bought a $250 samsung galaxy tab A 10.1 (2016 version) with S-pen and its WAYYYYY better... bottom line you get what you pay for... also hint the s-pen version has an extra 1 GB of ram over the non pen version... so you should get that if you can afford the extra $50... The People I purchased this for during Christmas Holiday LOVED IT... I purchased two of these for my kids, ages 12 and 10. Forget the IPod touch. For the price, this tablet can\\'t be beat! They can download games, books and movies for free all included with my Amazon Prime membership. Awesome!! my kids enjoy the Fire HD and they love the picture quality Bought two of these tablets for my nieces for Christmas after we had originally bought the Amazon fire 7 inch which had a virus after 3 days of purchase and was unable to work good thing we played with it prior to giving as gift do to this being said I was very surprised on how well this tablet has held up to to not so careful 8 years olds playing with it daily we have had no problems screen is big enough for little hands to maneuver and see on was the highlight of there Christmas and still is would definitely recommend it Really like the updates this product has in comparison to my first one Functionality and ease of use are outstanding right out of the the box. Super clear screen and weight is minimum and is a joy to use. This tablet is great for kids and adults who have little to no knowledge of computers. It handles easily and has plenty of storage My god sister has been using these for years.What to read more! The latest Amazon 8\" HD tablet is a very good tablet for the price. The updated processor and extra memory (with expansion slot) allow for very good performance on all that we use this tablet for. Netflix, Hulu, browsing the internet, and doing e-mails all work very smoothly. Would recommend to anyone looking for a very cost effective tablet totally worth the money, has all the apps I use on a daily basis! Good tablet. Wife loves it and would recommend.... I use mine mainly for its bigger screen. I do all the same things i do on my phone..but love the big screen. I bought one for eaxh of my nieces too. And they both love theres. Making videos..playing music..reading books. They bith love them! Im happy i got them for all of us. And always reccomend them to my friends for their kids too. Amazon Fire HD8 is a great product for the price. I picked it up for $69 during the holiday shopping season. Replacing a 1st gen Samsung Tab 2. This thing is sooo much faster. Perfect size for reading Kindle books , emails, and doing the social media thing. It was a good gift for the price and had many features and options Not as fancy as the ipad, but a fraction of the cost works well with android system and all apps like on our android phones, cant beat the price My kids can play, read, watch movies and much more love it!!! Great tablet for reading books, but the bluetooth is hard to get working and there are much better tablets for games and movies I love this Kindle!! I am biased I think however I have had 3 previous ones I prefer Kindles to any other tablet This is a great tablet for kids. I love that their time on the tablet can be restricted. Easy to use. Good size. Great eReader. Not so expensive that I worry about my kids using it. This Tablet was purchased for our Grandmother so she could play games and read books on. Bought a few of these for Christmas gifts .Everyone is happy !Its a great device for the $$. Low price, and great quality as always from FIRE devices. I purchased this item for my husband and he has liked reading Kindle books on it and the other features like Silk, etc. Light little tablet with good features. Bought this for our year end holiday party raffle prize pool. Great price and people always have a use for an amazon tablet. Came with Kaspersky for free as well, which is a pretty generous complimentary add on. My 6 yr old daughter got this tablet from Santa for Christmas. So far she loves it, a little too much perhaps.. I only use it to manage her account/permissions and so far haven\\'t had any issues with it.. Software and HW not quite as refined as apple iPad products, but what can you expect at the lower price point. my opinion its a good option for the cost. Not as great as Apple Ipad, but it costs so much less. Still can get good use Has many educational apps I would definitely go into the settings if you\\'re a mother like me who Is a very strict of what your children watch on TV or what games and apps they download I would definitely recommend setting the parental controls before giving it to them. In my personal opinion as a mother I feel it helps by setting the restrictions/content on It helps keep their mind away from the gutter Bcuz most apps and Internet websites have inappropriate sites children should not be watching. We can\\'t control what they put on the Internet but we can control what our children watch and download they stay very occupied on educational apps ,read books most of these apps are free to I also recommend NOT putting a payment method option other than that my kids loved it the hd feature is what sold me on this product, along with the fact its a lotmore streamline than the older version that I have Very nice for light internet browsing, keeping on top of email, viewing videos, and reading e books, which I like to get free from the library. Good browser, good battery power, fast charge. Very relaxing to sit in a comfy chair and read or browse. Has given me hours of enjoyment and information for a minimal price. I bought this for my wife to replace her old Kindle and she loves it. Much easier to read than an iPad and updated features make it a great purchase. Great tablet and price. Ordering online easy. Not happy took so long to receive though. Best tablet, good price, nice looking. Ordering on line was easy. I got this for my mom for Christmas. Every time I visit, she shows me something else she can do with it. I\\'m so jealous, I hope I get one. This is my fourth Kindle...upgrading each time. Mine goes everywhere with me and is used throughout the day. Wouldn\\'t be without it. We bought this for our son when he went to college. He is able to upload all of his books and other documents. I purchased it for my mother-in-law and she loves it it was easier for her to use and understand The Amazon Fire is amazing! Picture clarity and sound are excellent! I highly recommend this tablet! Love it! Sharp picture and easy to use. And a fantastic price I like this is great I bought it my friend he was pleased abount I wanted a low cost but quality tablet and this one is a dream! Easy to navigate and excellent graphics. This a great tablet for everyone. Plenty of memory for downloading. Great features all around. I own two Nook tablets, another Kindle and a Samsung and this is the best one yet. Excellent battery life. Lets me check emails the Web and with Kindle. books can be switched from reads to listens. Also works better than the Nook with audiobooks. I bought this tablet for my 4 year old daughter. Too many advertisements. I would rather pay more and not have a single ad. This is a step up from what my son was using. He said it does well and easy to use. This is a good tablet for kids who are starting off I bought this for my 6 year old and it\\'s perfect. Faster & clearer than older versions. Awesome good size large enough for games and photos Great gift easy to use and she loves being able to take it anywhere I bought this to replace the 7 inch version I lost in the airport. I wanted the bigger screen and the higher resolutions. It is much when loading games in offline mode as well as videos I have downloaded from Amazon Prime to play on the plane when wifi is not available. That was a plus for me. And now that the updated Netflix app allows the same thing, I have plenty of videos. I can also play my .mp4 videos using VLC player that I load to a microSD card. Of course you have wifi and Bluetooth so great for surfing try he net or listening to music. The 8 in screen is perfect for lying in bed and watching my show. I highly recommend this. Intuitive user interface, rapid online access through well designed features, light weight, ergonomic buttons for volume and power. Overall a thoroughly well designed, excellent priced device for web browsing and social media. PURCHASED THIS WITH A STORE CREDIT AND LIKE IT A LOT. COMPARES WELL WITH MORE EXPENSIVE TABLETS..RECOMMENDED great device for the price. good looking screen, quick and efficient. amazon app store isn\\'t that bad either Great gift for any age. Wish I bought two. I can do everything on this that I was doing on my ipad Great budget tablet for web browsing. Also useful as an MP3 player and ebook reader. I got 2 of these for my 8 yr old twins. My 11 yr old has one but this one is better. Perfect way to get them to read This is a superb tablet for the price. It doesn\\'t come with the Android operating system. It has Amazon\\'s operating system. The battery last a good long time and apps run very fast. I would recommend this to anyone who wants a tablet. My daughter love her new tablet, I use for a few days and it\\'s pretty good So very happy with the new kindle ! I highly recommend this product ! It may be cheap but this is a great tablet and works awesome. My wife absolutely loves this tablet. It wad an early Christmas present Bought for my 11 year old son and he absolutely loves it. I bought this as a Christmas gift for my son. Very easy to use. This product is very handy on the go. I can check emails and find work for my truck. I am an Amazon Fan. Ive only had Amazon tablets so I cant compare them with any other brand. But, Amazon has great customer service, a lot of great apps. The HD 8 is a great tablet for watching movies, most games, and social media. Its not as good as the Kindle fire hdx. The speakers arent as good, the hdx has more of a surround sound, but the hd 8 is less expensive, has a place for a sims card for extra space, and has an ok front and rear facing camera. Overall its a great tablet for a great price. I previously had bought an older model of these tablets for my children. I wasn\\'t to happy with them. But this tablet is great, it has child safety features like wether you would like to have them surf the web to even limiting the amount of hours your child can use it. Very good tablet for what my kids will use it for which is mostly Netflix Hulu and even though there isn\\'t you tube app there are alternate apps that acces you tube. Got this tablet for Black Friday. Wow, 16 gigs, great screen, expandable memory, what a deal. Tablet is a must have for Amazon Prime members. It unlocks the door for all those great Prime perks; books, shows, and shopping. Pairs to Alexa. Great screen for books! Buy it already! Bought it on black Friday for 60$ .Value for money tablet. It lags at heavy tasks and also apps are reloaded when 2-3 apps are opened at same time. But at this price it is expected. Go for it if budget is <100$. overall this is a good tablet. it is best with those who have Prime Amazon and the ability to watch Amazon video. a good price for a good tablet but has limitations based on the operating system. for video watching and basic use a good choice I love the size and portability of this. Keeps me in touch and having fun. Nice tablet and couldn\\'t beat the Black Friday price I\\'m sorry I didn\\'t buy it sooner! Very easy to use. Love it. It feels a bit more rugged than my original Fire tablet, and I believe it is an excellent value. Good tablet for basic needs. Screens resolution is pretty good. Mostly using for reading and sometimes for watching movies/shows. Great feature is the possibility to use the card to expand the memory. Good product for great price! Bought as a gift for my 86 yr old mom to stalk her kids and grandkids on FB. She mastered it in a few.minutes with minimal instruction. Now I have to watch my posts. For a cheaper price this does more than my kindle- love having this tablet Had a smaller version. Love the bigger screen. Use this product more than a computer. I bought 2 of the kindles for my grandsons. They love them! Had them charged and set up right away. No issues at this point. Easy to use bought for our 5 year old, found a case which allows him to keep it safe. Great 8 inches tablet with and amazing storage for apps. Santa dropped this off for our 4th grader along with expanded memory. he uses it for Netflix and Youtube as well as Minecraft and other Apps. Why spend hundreds on something for basic kids needs? I\\'m sure this will last him a few years and is well worth the price. Got this tablet for my 3 year old son and he can not put it down. It is so much to do. So many learning games. I love this product This tablet runs smooth with all amazon apps, the internet runs at a steady frame rate and it had a decent sized screen. This is a good device for entertainment and entry level tasks. I think it can do a lot for the price. Nice price for the new model with Alexa built in and expandable storage! I have enjoyed the new Kindle,however, was extremely disappointed that it does not have an HDMI port like the old version did. this product is really awesome for kids to play in all sorts.We can use a strong case and let kids play in it . i like the features it has and it is easy to navigate. This is perfect my kids to do their school work on and have fun as well. Great gift for my dad. Clear picture and easy set up Love my kindle! Works better than expected! Kindle is much faster than my old tablet! I have never owned a tablet. Wanted an I-Pad like most, but couldn\\'t afford the sticker price. This one fit my needs perfect. I mainly just use it for web surfing and streaming video. No complaints so far! I would recommend this device. also great for listening to music and also for movies The screen picture is crisp and bright. I will use this tablet for many things. small and powerful... great adult toy for a reader This was purchased as a Christmas present for my aunt who lives with us. For the price, I thought it would be a good option for her since she doesn\\'t want to drop the cash on an iPad.For comparison, the closest thing I have is an 8\" insignia tablet with similar screen resolution, storage, and features that was released at the same time. The Fire tablet impresses me! It is more responsive than the existing android tablet I have.This tablet runs FireOS which is Amazon\\'s customized version of Android. Typically I do not like custom Android, preferring to have as close to a vanilla system as possible. I am not bothered by that with the Fire. If you need them the parental controls are second to none! The Amazon app store is extensive, although not as extensive as the Google Play store. Still you should be able to find pretty much everything you need there.This is not a flagship device, but performs incredibly for the price. I will most likely be purchasing one soon for myself. I was hoping to use Google launcher with this tablet but it is really locked down and you cannot change the launcher or the lock screen. Still cheap and fine for watching movies. Great tablet for reading and also surfacing the web, along with your favorite social media apps! The price is low because Amazon uses their adds to subsidize the price. The actual tablet works well. The biggest negative is that you can only install apps from the Amazon store. There are many Android Apps available in the google store that are not available in the Amazon store.I primarily use the tablet for bible gateway, dish anywhere, play some games, read the newspaper, and Facebook. In the future I want to try to use it with my local library. Screen is very clear and battery last a long time. Very good substitute if you can afford a iPad. The tablet works fine. It is responsive with good resolution. It is too tied to Amazon. It requires too many hoops to get apps such as Zinio to work. Until Amazon loosens its grip, I recommend only at a very good price. A Great value for the money you can save instead of a Ipad from Apple. Fun and reliable. Good quality for the money. Easy to use. Great for reading - nice image, easy on the eyes and lightweight. Bought this for my 10 year old daughter for Christmas! She LOVES it!!! A great alternative to a pricey iPad Mini!!! She uses it for watching Netflix, YouTube and we use it for homeschool. We are very happy with our purchase!!! I got this tablet on sale for my wife and she loves it So far so good with the kindle fire hd. still need to play with it to see how to maximize our use. We love Kindle Fire, we purchase it for an older couple and it\\'s easy to work. The Amazon Fire is a great tablet with awesome graphics. I use it mainly for surfing the web and have had no issues with it. Purchased for my nephew for Christmas. Used it everyday. Very good product and screen size is perfect for him. Great tablet for the price. My granddaughter loves how user friendly it is. got this for my nieces aged 6-13 they loved it and so did their parents really keeps them occupied This was a gift for mom. She enjoys that it\\'s easy to use and has good picture and sound quality. The price was also great Was wanting a bigger screen, which it is, trying to get use to different applications, so far seems easy. The Amazon fire is simply amazing I would not buy anything else. Didn\\'t want to go to the sites amazon wanted me to. We bought this for our three daughters! Got a kid proof case and added free time for a low monthly fee and couldn\\'t be happier! So much better than worrying about them breaking my phone or iPad! I love my Kindle. I won\\'t be without one. I\\'ve even bought an extra one, just in case. I believe it\\'s the best tablet on the market. Bought one to replace the smaller (non HD) version. Lot faster and picture is noticeably better. Would recommend for anyone not wanting to spend the extra $50 or so on the big names. Could not have asked for a better tablet for the money. I wasn\\'t looking for anything extreme. Just wanted it to look nice and do it\\'s job for games and browsing. Well it does that and more. Gave it to our son for Christmas and now I want one myself. We are going to buy another for my mother in law. Lightweight, simple layout. Snappy. Can\\'t go wrong. It was a perfect gift for my godson. He loved it! Definitely would recommend this product. I can do a lot of things on my Kindle I used to rely on the computer for. Excellent resource for children video streaming by Wifi using mobile hotspot with kids. The kindle fire tablets are great for the price. They have solid performance in battery life and processing power. The only downside is that the Operating System is a different variation of Android, so there could be some incompatibilities. best choice under 100$ in marketamazon is the best!!! I really didnt expect how its going to work.but its very good.gifted to my friend Bought this as a gift for my mom and this was to replace her original Kindle Fire. She\\'s have had a month now and is loving and no problems with it. This was a request from our 7 yr old granddaugter who had always asked her older sister if she could share hers due to we bought this same tablet/size a few yrs earlier. Loved the security/parental control options.Starfall a favorite educational app were told is a must have. Really enjoy Pics/Viber due to their in a different state. Also some games on a time limit. Size and resolution are perfect. This is the best device I have found for my e-books. I know it can be used for a lot more, but it is my library in my hand. I bought this tablet to be pretty much exclusively an e-reader. It\\'s actually cheaper than most of the kindles. For that limited use, it works fine. I don\\'t think I would want to use it as a general purpose table (too slow!). Makes a fine e-reader though. As for recommending this to a friend, I would, but would make sure they knew what I use it for. I bought this as a Christmas present for my sister and she LOVES it. It\\'s easy to use, lightweight and doesn\\'t seem to have a lot of bugs or glitches. It\\'s a good source of entertainment for when she\\'s at work but has down-time. She passes the time reading ebooks, browsing the web and playing games. I originally purchased a Kindle paperwhite but returned it the next day and purchased this one. Very easy to read on, watch movies, and listen to music. Works well. Easy to use. Battery seems to be good. Would buy again. Ticks all the boxes I was looking for at a price I was happy to pay. One caveat that I (or the Best Buy and Geek Squad crews) was unaware of: there is a glitch in the keyboard that prevents it from working properly. Kindle/Amazon are aware of the glitch and will download a third-party keyboard fix to replace the keyboard that\\'s built in to the unit until they are able to fix the problem. I made Geek Squad aware of it and they should know about it now. Amazon MayDay functionality is not available and this was unexpected. Other services and functionality as expected Perfect tablet to take anywhere you go and lighter than my IPad. Easy to use tablet for every day use. Additional apps can help increase productivity for work and daily use. This tablet does all I need a tablet to do. Reason why it\\'s my 3rd one. Bought this tablet for my fiancée daughter, after getting it home and set up, I decided to keep it for myself. Great screen and works great with my pair of Amazon echos. I love it and highly recommend it. This is my first Amazon e-reader-tablet and the second e-reader I have. It is easy to use once you get through the initial hoops. I like the free games and the fact that I new can load books from my computer to the tablet. And one thing, I am not in the market for a tablet but for a bigger e-reader. It is a lot better than the Nook that I have. I love this product Bought as a gift for parents who aren\\'t tech savy but were able to use it with ease I have Bought several versions of this tablet for my kids over the years and have been ever impressed with it. I first got one for my son, the my oldest daughter to replace her children\\'s tablet, which was worthless, this tablet gives you everything you could want and allows you to control what your kids access on it and even lets you see what they download onto it. if you want to set a time when it shuts off at night you can, when they can play games or use Netflixs you can...great product! Great gift for a younger person who wants a tablet The fire is great. The size is really nice. Not to big. The clarity is really good. This inexpensive tablet does everything I want it to do. I can read my books and magazines and keeps tabs on my kids and grandkids on Facebook. Very easy to use and crystal clear pictures and video. Great entry level tablet for kids or anyone that will not be heavily using a tablet. The 16 GB, is too small but can add an SD card. Beware only comes with 6GB of the 16 for your apps. Comes with bunch of preloaded Amazon apps. This tablet is great. I loved the color and all the features it has. I will be buying more for my daughters. Great purchase What I expected. A better then budget tablet ata good price. Bought for the integration with Alexa and it works well, more info about your Alexa request will show up automatically on the tablet. It\\'s a excellent tablet for my kid she downloaded games and watch cartoons I was looking for a Good tablet under $100..this delivered..getting used to Amazon apps LOL Excellent ratio quality price. Lightweight. Good resolution and easy to use. After long review decided to buy the Fire Tablet as a gift for a great frienday. She loves it! It\\'s the perfect size and has all the features she was looking for in a tablet. Happy Birthday! Love everything about my Kindle. I\\'m a long-term Amazon Prime member. Great tablet for the price. My father in law likes the easy use of the tablet. The Fire is an excellent table for many basic tasks. Not a good product short battery life i can only use for 20 minutes I was looking for something to read on and this fit the bill for the right price.Great screen clarity, good adjustment too. Works well and the battery life is great. Size is nice too. Big enough for 1 hand if needed. This is a great tablet for books, games and web browsing. It is very user friendly, -and I would definitely recommend this product! I enjoy to use the reader and like the idea that I can go to the internet from the Kindle. I thought that this tablet was junk but it has surpassed my expectations I wasn\\'t really expecting much, however I was pleasantly surprised.It feels solid, responsive, screen is good.For the price its a bargain!! Good if you want something inexpensive and Will do the minimum very well. I like this ipads for my baby and me too,special and super ok thanks byee I found it to be very versatile and enjoyable benefiting from a touch screen. Ipad killer! A fierce tablet at a convinient price! bought as a gift she loves it all kinds of apps easy to use and even easyer with amazon prime I bought it as the display for my Echo. Turning on Voicecast routes information to the tablet with the voice reaponse. It\\'S been exactly what I hoped it would be and the price was right. This tablet is exactly what I was looking for to take on trips. The kids can watch their movies and videos, or I can read from my kindle library. Perfect size. I bought this as a gift for my son and I know he will love it he has the old kindle fire as likes it a lot My mom had an old one, she was so excited to get this one. Works great and is fast. Great for reading and internet use This Kindle is so overloaded with apps that I will never use. Despite what one of Best Buys\\' associates said, you cannot remove any of the Amazon apps. The apps take up too much of the memory. I have an I Pad and love but bought this as a backup for work. Unfortunately, it bogs down. I also don\\'t like that Amazon wants access to too much info to set up email, so I won\\'t use this for emails either. I will likely sell it on Craig\\'s List for less than half of what I paid for it. Fine for reading, ...haven\\'t used it for anything else yet I have been using a Kindle Fire for a couple of years. It was a good tablet, until the screen went black. Best Buy replaced it and I couldn\\'t have been more pleased. I enjoy reading on my Kindle Fire HD more than ever. Try it and you\\'ll buy it! A viable substitute for the more expensive I Pad especially for kids wanting a tablet. You can download books, games, email and access the internet. Parental controls are easily enabled. blueray is just twhat I was I was looking for great for watching movies thank you Love best buy and I shop at Best Buy I always buy my TV for me and my kids I buy my kids tablets at Best Buy Love Best Buy Got this for my mom for her birthday, and she absolutely loves it. Great tablet for the price point, good tablet overall. I love all of them. I would recommend going to Best Buy and buying a kindle fire before they are sold out! Nice size screen easy and light weight to take to class This tablet is great for my son. Would be nice if it had a little more horsepower My 76 year old mom loves this! She now has something to do while waiting in doctors offices - loves to read, do crosswords, etc. I enjoy it more then the I-pad that its replacing. Easy to read in any light and the size is perfect for travel. I absolutely love my kindle 8! Great picture, storage & sound. Can\\'t live without my kindle! I liked it at first except the browser is kind of clunky. Also you can. It use all android Apps. The worst thing though was mine just stopped working in the middle of watching a movie on a long plane flight. It was fully charged. I have tried recharging and turning on etc. it is just a blank screen and off. Kind of a cool paperweight. Hope I can get my money back. Or get a new one. Love my mine! Works great with prime! And I have all my best movies! I bought this for my dad in his late 60s mainly to listen to music and read ebooks borrowed from the library. I set it up for him and he loves it. I just don\\'t like that it has ads on the start up unless you pay to get rid of them. Enjoy reading books on it as well as viewing videos. Got two for my mom\\'s and they love it. So many great features!!! this tablet is awesome. the fact that I can use a micro sd card to have more memory and can listen to my content on the card is great. the additional screen size is what I wanted and it has not disappointed. this was a great purchase!!! I\\'m very happy with my Kindle Fire. Beyond being able to read books, it does all sorts of things and is able to download a huge variety of apps. It also holds a charge very long. The size is perfect and portable, yet the screen is much larger than a smartphone, which I love. I would definitely recommend this tablet to others! The Amazon Fire HD 8 is an awesome device. THE PRICE OF THIS TABLET IS MIND BOGGLING!! This tablet has everything you would expect and want in a tablet and more. It has Amazon Store and Amazon Prime preloaded. It\\'s so much fun and so easy to use. THE PERFORMANCE OF THIS TABLET IS UNBELIEVABLE. You never stop thinking about the modest price you paid for such a fantastic tablet. It feels comfortable in your hands. The design is nice. The size is adequate for all tablet use. You can expand the memory storage of this device an additional 240GB. Can you believe it? Outstanding!! Bought as a Christmas present. Son uses it to watch youtube and Netflick. Works great. The overall design makes it fir very nice in the hand. It is very easy to setup and has features that I did not utilize on previous Fire tablets. I like the camera and the Blue Shade ability. I like to read before bed and the color really does help me wind down. Long lasting battery! Got this Fire tablet for my youngest daughter for Christmas and she loves it. I also love the option to restrict apps and content for her age! I bought two of these Amazon Fire HD tablets in December as Christmas gifts. Both recipients are happy with these as gifts. I plan to purchase one in the near future for myself. Biting as a gift, my only concern was the size and the Amazon interface. It was easy enough to download the Google play store, so it was familiar to the user. Size was an initial concern, but it was just right to watch movies without being so cumbersome. My son really likes the larger screen to play games. Very easy to use and has so much to offer for the low price. great product, easy to use, love the lighted pad, ease of down loading books, They were using them on Christmas morning!! It didn\\'t take them long too be getting the best from those tablets So I think I would have rated 5 stars however when I got my tablet home my 8 year old used it for a total of 2hrs...the next day it had a reboot screen similar to Dos windows. Excellent customer service at store allowed me to exchange next day. No problems with the second one. Great tablet for the price. i love it amazon is nice read book on it play games on it I bought this Kindle as a gift for my mother so she could access her Facebook account easily. She loves the ease of using it. I have 3 kindle tablets in my home and they are used daily. My mother uses hers for email and some light gaming and for watching Netflix as well. Very satisfied. I wanted a low cost internet device to feed internet radio choices into my stereo. This fit the bill well. I use the headphone jack to connect with my stereo and get great sound. I don\\'t use most of the other apps that come on the device. The Kindle Fire is a wonderful, small device to use for a multitude of tasks. We use it mostly as an ereader and has been so simple to use. So happy we chose this one. It is lightweight and convenient to take with you. I bought this as a temporary replacement for my wife\\'s 11\" Kindle Fire HD that was out for service. She liked this 8\" model so much that she continued using it after the 11\" one returned. I tested this item before I gave it as a gift. It is simple enough for the needs of browsing, social media and entertainment. Definitely best price for simple needs compared to spending $100s on an iPad This feels like an affordable tablet. While not the best in class, it isn\\'t priced to be that either. Works well. Happy with purchase. Great for watching sports events away from home but within wi fi range. So easy to download and then read. Enjoy reading that I can take anywhere without the heaviness of a book I bought this after subscribing to an Amazon Prime membership. This is a great little tablet at such a low price.. too good of a deal to pass up when it was on sale. It has the ability to talk to Alexa, surf the web, listen to music and read books/magazines (lots of free music and books for Prime members). If ads dont bother you, then this may be a decent device. Purchased this for my kid and it was loaded down with so much spam, it kept loading it up making it slow and laggy. Plus the carrasoul loadout makes it hard to navigate for kids, not very kid friendly! Oh you can pay $15 to remove the ads but it wont remove them all. Buy the samsung, better everything! This is my second Fire, I\\'m upgrading from the 2nd generation 7\" model. Love the screen resolution. Movies and videos are sharp and no pixelating. The camera is a bonus my first version did not have. All together this was a great buy for under $100 on sale. Thank you Best Buy. I would buy it again and have twice over already. I actually bought the kids fire kindle and bought this for my wife, her\\'s was lost and she borrowed my sons kid fire kindle I ended up buying her this again, and would buy it again. I would recommend buying a sd card it fills up fast without out it but it is a lot cheaper to buy the lower GB kindle and then buy a good sd card. This tablet has it all. Amazon offers tons of free apps, hundreds of thousands of free e-books and tons of free games. The tablet is intuitive and intelligent. I seamlessly enjoy streaming my favorite shows and reading articles, books and periodicals. What I love most is that the tablet doesn\\'t place all apps on the device, but uses the users miro SD card instead for up to 200GB of additional storage for a dizzying amount of storage for more games, apps, books and movies that can be downloaded and enjoyed. It also allows the owner to share the device with family members, delegating each member an account personalized and tailored to that individual. There is even an option to create children\\'s accounts--extra bonus. I am able to mirror the content from the tablet onto my Samsung Smart television. I will definitely consider Amazon first and foremost when making any future tablet purchases. It maintains a charge for a good deal of time, alleviating the need to be near an outlet to enjoy using it. I can charge it in the evening and use it for several hours the next day, sometimes two days. No one will ever create a tablet that is more considerate of the owner/end-user. I love to read and this tablet makes it so easy to carry an entire library with me everywhere. I have also become addicted to the free underground games. Bought this 8\" model to use in addition to my current 3 year old Kindle Fire HD (7 inch model). So far I am very pleased with the quality of this unit. The slightly larger screen makes watching movies much better. I didn\\'t want the larger 10\" screen (yet). I purchased this on Black Friday because I could pass on the price. The tablet works great for basic internet needs and great for shopping on Amazon. If I were to purchase another Android Tablet, I will look for something with a little more power since this tablet slows when multi-tasking. I bought this for my son (he\\'s 1.5 years old) so he could play basic toddler games, but I found the tablet to be extremely useful for school with it\\'s large screen and super long battery life. I\\'m waiting for the Surface Pro 5 but this tablet that I got for so cheap is making me second guess paying so much! For basic lecture taking notes and watching Netflix or Hulu and kid games, this can\\'t be beat. The best tablet for the price i use it everyday to watch youtube videos Great purchase for my granddaughter for Christmas. This tablet is perfect for just about anything you could want to do on a tablet. My grandmother enjoys this tablet ... it use as her reader. Great item at great price, MY WIFE LOVES IT AND WONT PUT IT DOWN! great black friday deal for a mediocre tablet. android os though! Wanted a tablet at a cheap price and this item fit the bill. Bought on Black Friday which made the price even better. The screen looks good and the performance for the apps I have used so far have met expectations. I mainly used for surfing the web, youtube, and netflix. This device handles each with ease. Overall, I am satisfied with this device. Works well; no issues with reboots or system hangs.. Good size - not too big and not too small. Screen is good for reading. Battery life is good, I\\'ve bought a few books from Amazon but mostly side-loaded books from the library onto a 32 GB micro sd card. Though I have got it for cheap price during black friday, this Fire is not that great. Very bad camera and dim screen resolution. Pros:Install Google Play without any hassleVery good book reading option I got this for my son and he loves it! He can play games, watch movies, you tube videos, and use the internet for help with homework. He also loves all the books, and aps. Was a great black Friday deal should have gotten one for myself. I got it at a great price. They price matched for me. Much faster then getting my laptop out to check email I purchased this product for my youngest son! He loved the color and the size. The storage is great for the number of activities that he has downloaded! Was looking for a tablet to run my remote music server with from my easy chair. My first tablet I bought at about the same price ran through the battery in an hour. Amazon product is much better for battery life and image quality is very nice. This product is easy to use. Screen size is great. Would recommend to anyone. I got it for my kid and she loves it. The amazon free time and prime well worth the money Best tablet around, cheaper than most and does just as much as other tablets. Great buy, it works perfect! Battery lasts a few days too. She likes to read books and this is a fast and cheap way for her to do so It\\'s a great buy. Just to read emails and go on the web Great Christmas gifts for the kids. Hours of fun and games. I purchased this tablet mostly for entertainment. I enjoy playing games and this tablet is great for that purpose. Also plan on using it for reading electronic books. Very nice quality product. East to set up and use. So much more screen size than previously kindles. Fast charging. Longer battery life. Purchased for my mom to read ebooks, great performance, screen looks good, easy to use. Very happy with this purchase. less expensive than last year with so many more features and bigger screen! Bought for my wife for X-mas and she loves it. Hasn\\'t put it down This is a good product for video, surfing and reading. However this version has dropped all android support as far as I can tell. I have a couple of apps that run on my old Fire just fine but are extremely problematic on this one. There is one app I use everyday but it doesn\\'t work on this new Fire, so I have to keep the old one around. Kind of inconvenient. I would recommend seeing if your app is supported on this Fire before dropping the money. This was a reasonable replacement for a broken tablet. Purchased this tablet for my two year old son. It is easy for him to use and has been surprisingly durable. Would recommend the replacement plan if purchasing for a child. Better and faster than Kindle 7\". Great performance for the price. Love it, easy to operate. Very reasonable price - on sale. Good product. Onboard storage does fill up quickly. Bought as a gift to my dad and he likes it so far. It\\'s fast enough for apps and great for reading Works great but the app store is nothing like that of Apple or Google. Fortunately, you can install many Android apps from 1Mobile. The screen is fabulous and it\\'s great at its roots: making reading books fun. I love this tablet. I know it\\'s not an iPad or any of the big tablets but it does just what I need it to do. I\\'ve had it a few weeks now. I\\'ve downloaded videos, read a few books and played some games. I\\'ve had zero problems so far. I know it\\'s not the best video, but for the price of the tablet I don\\'t expect it to look like my flat screen TV. I\\'m trying not to load too many things to keep it from slowing down. So far so good. Browsing the internet is easy too. I\\'m getting used to the browser and the app store for Amazon. For the price of this tablet it\\'s not too shabby!!! You can do some many things and the best part apps for free on Amazon underground! Works great for my 6 year old. Wanted an inexpensive tablet for himsince he can be pretty rough with things. So far so good, and we love the FreeTime app. Was looking to get an inexpensive tablet that ran Android. The Amazon Fire tablet was a much better value than other similar products. Have been very happy with the tablets durability and quality so far too. Would recommend to anyone looking for a lower-end tablet. Bought 2 for each of our teenagers and they just love it... Very cool reading features and zero buffering while watching Netflix. Good quality product. Clear display and easy to use. My mother, husband, and daughter all enjoy using Fire. It\\'s a great way to stay preoccupied. Out of all the tablet choices out there we buy these for our children over any other. You can\\'t beat the price and durability. very good product and right on the cost! Great gift for the holidays. Purchased this for reading and the price. Good value for money. Great for reading, game playing, searching the web and social media. I really like the Fire IS 8 16gb, it is fast and smooth. Does everything a regular tablet can and for the price you really can\\'t beat it This is so easy to use and does exactly what I hoped. Great tablet for streaming ! good internet connection along with a nice display Bought it as an e-reader. Convenient and easy to use. Text is very readable. I am pleased. This is a nice little tablet for the $60 I paid on black Friday. At the regular price I would probably have gone with something a little less restricted and without so much Amazon content. The lock screen ads aren\\'t much of a problem, I understand Amazon sells these cheap and gets it back via ads, but the 15-20 Amazon apps are a little much. It would be easier to stomach if you could add the ones you want or remove the ones you don\\'t. That said, I was able to install the Google Play store and this tablet does everything I need it to do. Overall, I\\'m pretty happy with the purchase. It\\'s a nice new toy. One note: In the online photos the magenta looks purple. It\\'s actually pink. If you like purple, get a black one and a purple case. So cool after playing with this for a while now I would never spend the money on an apple for what I am doing with it. Love the new fire hd 8. Price is amazing and if you are an amazon prime mbr its even better! Great for the kids as you can lock their profiles to a kids mode and they can\\'t buy anything. If i had one downfall its the smaller amount of apps available than apple or google play. Had the Fire HD 7\" before and just wanted to upgrade. Loving it so far and really enjoying the bigger screen! The tablet is not for me it is for a Christmas gift This was a great buy for my son. He needed something that he could easily transport and that woudl allow him to access the internet and various forms of media. This was a perfect choice since he also has a amazon Prime account. This was replacement for my wife\\'s original iPad and broken Kindle Paperwhite. She loves it, as it does basically everything both of the previous devices did in one unit that is easy to use, has good battery life, very nice screen resolution and good size for her. Great value, especially compared to an iPad. for the price this is a great works well the for the price display is hd love it for the money, you will be well pleased, I think it is a big bargain ! I purchased this tablet for my mother, but I set it up and tested it out. It is super fast! I have the original Kindle Fire and all I can say is Amazon has come a long way! The new Fire HD8 is so much better than the original! I like it so much that I am thinking of purchasing one for myself! I would highly recommend this tablet to anyone! I have had a Kindle before, and needed a new one as the old one would no longer charge very well. Still adjusting to some different features from the original one. Do not like the fact that it is difficult to find a case for this one. Very happy with this purchase, it was exactly what I was looking for My original Kindle Fire no longer accepted a charge. I wasn\\'t going to replace it, because I bought an iPad. When I saw the HD8 in a kiosk in a BB store, I realized how much better I liked the size and feel of it for reading books (the iPad is preferred for other things). This Fire\\'s clarity is much improved over my old one, plus it responds better. I don\\'t like that I can\\'t choose a photo for the locked screen - that it HAS to be an advertisement. I also don\\'t like that it usually takes a few trys to unlock. Menial issues from my perspective. It\\'s a good starter tablet, to bad it runs on the Amazon OS. Got this for my sister as a Christmas present and she loved it.Easy to use and great for books. This is my third Kindle, I still have the other two; however, this has a camera and much larger screen. I would take this product any day over a tablet. Look forward to hearing more from my grandkids so far they love it Good small tablet for all purposes for reading, playing games My wife and kids love easy to use and the size is perfect Great tablet for beginners! Very light and screen is wide. Enjoy using for travels. Fast processing great battery reads to me when my eyes bother me. Expandable memory a big plus. The new kindle fire hd is good and my son loves it Got this for my grandmother and she absolutely loves it. She loves to use it to watch Netflix and play games This is just the right size and can put games on it just like an iPad. I wanted a new kindle fir a while. The price was right The display is not as sharp and vivid as they say but still good. Probably better for reading than watching videos. We didn\\'t really get it for the games, but there is a good selection. WiFi works well and internet browsing is fast. The Kindle is a great way to read and watch videos with ease! Exciting tablet still amazed by the ease of use great product all in all Couldn\\'t beat the value for this with the Black Friday price. They aren\\'t the best tablets, but they do a lot for the price. great size,sound and battery. just buy it already. Love the tablet mainly use for games and internet. Grrat product foe the price. She hasn\\'t used the it yet, but my son did a quick check and it seems just fine. I\\'ve had my other Kindle Fire for 5-6 years. It\\'s still working but slowing down. I bought the updated version while it was on sale. I love it! I play games on it, download books, check my email and facebook. It\\'s like a portable mini computer and I wouldn\\'t be without it. I like it better than other people\\'s tablets and you can\\'t beat the price. I bought some for gifts and everybody loves it! I\\'d recommend it to people of all ages. Great product, no complaints at all,good for kids and adults At ninety dollars, the expectionations are low, but this is still a very good table, it\\'s good for light use like watching videos or web browsing, but the camera is a bit lacking, and at certain times the device can freeze or lag. Overall this is a good tablet for $90, I would recommend this to anyone on a budget. Good starter unit. Easy for a beginner to use. Priced low to give you a taste of the tablet world. The Parental Options need some work. You can\\'t even log in to a child account until you have Apps loaded for them to use. Also a kid\\'s login doesn\\'t have access to pre-loaded apps (like the calculator). Seems really odd to me that you can\\'t give them access to basic functionality of the tablet.Otherwise, the tablet itself works great. Bought a Fire HD 8 tablet for my wife. She doesn\\'t like using computers and avoids smartphones, but her new tablet is a big hit. She uses it to play games and to stream movies and radio programs. I use it for everything else -- reading news, checking e-mail, online shopping, etc. It was very easy to set up and even easier to use. Plenty of speed and capacity to do everything we want. We already own kindles so we know they are great ! My son is going to live this! I purchased 2 of these FIre HD tablets as gifts. They pack a lot of punch for the price. I helped set them up so I was able to get an idea of how they are going to work. The screen was very nice and clear. Speed of tablet was good. It is easy to use. If you are already in the Amazon family through prime it is a no-brainer.I don\\'t believe you can get a better tablet at this price point. I bought these as a starter online browser. It is a very portable pad . Great price. Just what my wife wanted and needed she loved it! It is easy to use and simple to set up! Good tablet for the money. A good add on if you have Amazon prime You can\\'t beat the price. Great deal for what you\\'re paying. We bought it for our 9 yr. Old daughter and she loves it. We do as well. Kindle tablets are great! its fast, it has good lighting. its got the 16gb space, best gift ive bought for a bookreader. I love it.....Reading E books here is so easyPerfect for price With a $20 off deal last blackfriday, who will not get it. Much clearer and faster than the other fire HD. Light weight too If you shop on Amazon all the time, this will help make it easier still. Lots of ads pop up, and you can\\'t use apps from non-Amazon sources unless you root it, and that is complicated. This is not a realistic alternative to an iPad or Galaxy Note. If you just want to a device to shop on Amazon with, you\\'ll love it. This is my 2nd Fire tablet. I will alwyas need one. Just wish they lasted longer than 4 years. fire tablet is very powerful for the size and does everything! While there are some apps that are missing due to not using the Google Play Store the list is minimal. The tablet itself is quick, responsive, and noticeable nicer than the 7\" fire. Picked this up when it was on sale for black friday sales. It\\'s great for in front of the TV and catching up on email and light web browsing. Price was fabulous for an entry level tablet. Right on Was impressed how quick and responsive touch and overall speed.Including Alex app.fit in top coat pocket I have been buying Kindles since they first came out. When ever I want to upgrade Kindle is my chosen brand. I am not very tech savvy and I enjoy watching movies, listening to music and primarily reading. I like the ability to purchase narration for my favorite titles and using text-to-speech for the rest. Have not used these yet as they are Christmas gifts Wife loves this thing. She reads nonstop on it. She can\\'t put it down Nice for the price had to put Google play store on myself but still a nice tablet This is a really good tablet for adults but especially great for kids as you can load movies or add apps that they can use. The cost is so low you just can\\'t beat it. Plus, the main feature for me was the Amazon Kindle name on the product which puts it way ahead of the no name tablets on the market. Great product and gift. I purchased two of these on Black Friday. What a great purchase. These are very inexpensive and have the ability to do so many things for the kids. I later bought tough cases to keep any damage minimal. I love my kindle. I bought the larger screen after owning 2 previous 7 inch screens. this tablet has the best battery ive ever seen. The picture is great too. LIke that there are lots of apps to choose from. Very user friendly I wanted a new tablet and saw the 7\" on sale at Christmas, my husband was offered the 8\" for just $10 more, so good value ! Thin and light weight. Easy to start up. I would have liked to have a booklet on featuers and use, etc. Nothing in print came with it other than one paper . Tutorials on set up and where the buttons and slots were. I have enjoyed the quick loading to start, just wish I had a physical booklet on how to\\'s, not just online tutorials. More features In several ways than iPad. This android tablet is really powerful I bought this for my wife because she plays a lot of games along with my grandson, this is perfect to download all the games they want without taking up space on her iPad. Great to take with me when I need alone time to just surf and read. Love the tablet! Easy to use and easy to take with Awesome tablet! Love using it to read and surf the web. It matters what preference you prefer with tablets. I mean if you use windows or google more this might not be for you. For me, I use Amazon music, video, books, and shopping so this tablet is awesome. It\\'s made especially for Amazon ecosystem users. Its light and has a nice feel. I live the blue shade option it has for less blue light when reading. Enjoy having the kindle. My son uses all the time for reading. It has helped him improve in his reading skills. We are glad we bought it. Thank you. This was one of the best birthday presents, I ever purchased for my husband. He said he doesn\\'t use the computer, but he was on my smartphone daily viewing FB. I got him a drone for Christmas and he needed something to view, while it is flying. I researched the Kindle Fire and thought he could practice with it until spring. He farms, so isn\\'t busy in the winter. Thank goodness, because he is busy with his Kindle for hours every day. He thinks it is great and I do too, because now I have my phone back. I really enjoy reading. So much so I was running out of shelf space. I have read a few books with my I-pad mini but it really didn\\'t do the trick. No so with my new Amazon Fire Hd-8. Handy sized, not the least bit heavy and super bright. Add in the face that digital material from magazines to novels are often as not far cheaper that \"hard copies\". Amazing video quality easy to maneuver wonderful screen size easy set up Great tablet other than the photo image quality is fuzzy and not the best. The Fire HD8 strikes an excellent balance between performance and price. It has many of the features you\\'d want in a tablet for a fraction of the cost. Works flawlessly for reading and video streaming. This is my second Kindle and I love it. It\\'s lightweight, simple, and fast. It\\'s convenient for trips and fits in my bag without weighing it down. Bought this as a gift. My mother likes it. It\\'s easy and simple to use. I am loving my fire tablet and I am using it everyday at home and at work on break I will be ordering Amazon fire for my two granddaughters because they love Nana\\'s so much Really beautiful display is great for watching movies and playing games. It is very powerful for the price and you can play lots of games from Amazon for free - they even remove microtransactions from lots of games.Only downside is you need Amazon Prime to get the most out of your tablet Very little set up, Amazon helpful in setting up the functions. Clear pictures and easy to use. Take pictures both ways Graphics are great for the price. Would highly recommend. Bought this for my mom and it was just what she needed and at a great price. Been wanting to get an Ipad for myself, but think this might be a great less expensive option for me as well. The pad worked as I thought but the screen wasn\\'t as vibrant as our iPads. Still a great deal for the price. Perfect thing I needed to read books on and play my games I\\'m loving the tablet so far. I really like the Amazon underground, and the Fire OS just updated, so it has Alexa on it now. :) this tablet is perfect for surfing the internet and following social media I like the shape and size of this Kindle, and the graphics are good. But if I play a game for very long the charge seems to run out pretty quickly. It is very good for books and for music. I would recommend it for those categories. For its price. Amongst the others I felt this was a deal Perfect size and very responsive. I have 4 of them. No issues runs games and internet well. ,,,,,,,,,,,, It is very easy to use for children . We have loved having one and are hoping to buy another one for kids Christmas !! good price for the product. I purchased for my middle school son. not good, hate it , never buy it again, sucks. done Smartphone works on the job for me, but with the Fire I can read instructions and worksheets. It is a useful tool for connecting with both friends and colleagues. 8-inches is the right size for holding in hand and carrying with you. Gives me the information, beats printing everything out, or carrying around a large laptop. Think this will be a great product for my parents it is a Christmas gift. The Amazon fire tablet is an excellent product. I primarily use it to purchase and read books from Kindle. Also, I use it for my Facebook activity. The battery life is long and it recharges quickly. My 10 year old son also enjoys using it. I would highly recommend this product to others. My husband is a truck driver and being on the road away from home, he likes to have shows and movies to watch. This has so much space for him to download things to watch. A great Kindle reader. Easy to order, read and store books. Also speedy for finding Amazon products and ordering them. But the other apps are really slow - too slow. Easy to use as a tablet and easy to use as a ebook reader Not sure if this is due to the new version but I\\'m not able to install or even sideload certain apps onto the tablet. Amazon is really trying to lock out non-Amazon apps namely ones from Google. Aside from that though, performance is already and what you\\'d expect from a tablet in this price range. This was purchased for my mom and it does what\\'s needed and my mom has no complaints thus far. Tablet is working good for what we wanted it to do. Still waiting for Alexa to function. Several calls to Amazon supportled to conflicting answers on how to get it to work, then told it isnot yet available on all Fire HD 8 tablets. The Amazon Fire Hd8 has great features. The size is perfect to carry anywhere. Excellent apps and accessible to books, movies, games etc. Clear screen. it was very quick and easy to setup and begin using. I have had several budget tablet, but this blows them all away. You have to be willing to be invested in the Amazon ecosystem, but it is well worth it. This tablet is a good one for everyday use. It is small but it has a clear image. Not sure if I really wanted one this small but its ok for now. This does not run Android, so no Google Play store. Amazone apps are moztly the same titles, but not all are available that you can get through Google Play. Bought this for our daughter and she enjoys it. If you have an Amazon Prime subscription you can get a lot more out of this tablet as well. Bought for daughter, love the parental control and curfew setting I like the portability of it. I take it with me when I babysit my granddaughter. bought as a gift she loves it great with amazon prime Had the previous version of this tablet and was looking to upgrade. Got this on sale and am very pleased. My daughter love this tablet! Easy to use and carry The best kindle fire ever, love how quickly the apps run, being able to watch movies, listen to music, etc. on it The salesman was very good pointed us in the right direction. The tablets are perfect for our triplet grandsons. Excellent value for the price. Super easy to use and set up. Wonderful display. I love the fact that you can add an sd card for more memory unlike the old Kindles. Plus I\\'m really impressed with the fact the Amazon has such great offers. I love my kindle. It fast, great pict quality and is so convenient to use. I love using it to watch Netflix. It worth the purchase if you don\\'t want to spend so much money. I love this tablet!! Excellent quality speakers and screen. Lots of storage space. Worth the money!! Bought it for my husband and he loves it. This is perfect for what he wanted it for. Very fast and super easy to use I\\'m very pleased with this purchase!! It\\'s works really well and don\\'t have any issues at all Tablet is good for beginners and those that like to read The Kindle Fire has great features for the price. The video quality is asstounding. It worked really well for me as I am unschooled in ipads. I used it while traveling and it was easy to use and did the things I needed, i.e. maps, books downloaded, internet access, youtube, etc.. I don\\'t play games, so cannot comment on that. If you want a tablet to use on a daily basis for facebook or do online purchases you couldn\\'t ask for a better tablet. I use to read books, watch movies, and get online.. it works great and easy to use. I bought this to replace a Samsung Galaxy Tab 3. I absolutely love the Kindle HD 8. It was easy to set up and very easy to find my way around. The only reason I took off 1 star is that I have found some apps are not available for Kindle. But so far from info I have read online there are ways to resolve this issue. Just a simple kindle. Doesn\\'t have the glass back. Throughly enjoying my fire tablet. Can play games and read books. Am very pleased with it. Excellent screen , fast response. Almost a steal for that price. Much harder to work than an android. None of the wallpaper apps I downloaded from the kindle store work on the device. many of the other apps look cheap on the display. other wise it is prettier and more responsive than the cheaper $49 tablet. They make it look like an android tablet but it is not. no google play. Everything is just harder to work than on a regular android BUT for a tablet under $100 it exceeds expectations. It is more responsive than other models of fire Kindle Fire is a dream. Larger screen easy to read I HAVE BEEN WITH AMAZON PRIME FOR 2 YEARS AND THIS NEW FIRE HD MAKES IT WORTH IT. i WATCH MOVIES WHEN I FLY BECAUSE I CAN DOWNLOAD THEM. THE BATTERY LAST FOR DAYS. I USE IT EVERYDAY NOW. Well worth the 80 bucks, especially if you are an Amazon Prime member. You can download and watch anything on there for free, including movies and magazines. The screen is a bit on the darker side, but the battery life is great. I have both an IPAD and this, and I use both. Great when you are waiting for your IPAD to recharge... Reading is easy, can make font as large as you need Improved over the HD 7. Things set up differently but not hard to learn. Also a bit heavier than the 7 so reading in bed a little harder Not to much to complain about. for less than 100 dollars you get an 8in tablet that has pretty good specs; expandable storage, long battery life, great speakers, fast processor, decent cameras and hi def screen. easy to use and well built tablet....The only knock is the included adds but, after using it for awhile you barely notice it. I\\'ve purchased a number of Kindle Fire products for family over the past several years and continue to use them. Easy to use for even my youngest Grandchildren or my 87 year old Mother-In-Law which they use as a reader and for games. An overall good value. This is the fastest booting tablet I have come across. The speed at which I can access sites is really amazing. I went into bestbuy to purchase a replacement after mine died. I loved my kindle, and decided to get 2-in-1 with the fire. It is perfect for my needs. I had fire hdx 8 and loved it, unfortunately got damaged and could not replace. I purchased the fire HD 8 and exchanged n pay difference for fire HD 10. The 8 did not have a lot of options I was used to. :( great product at a great price.i like the builtin filter which is easy on youreyes.probably the best reader under 100 dollars. Very good product. Super quality and the Best Buy store rep explained me about the product This is my third Kindle Fire and it improves each time. Colors are crisper and best of all it stays charged a lot longer. I bought this for my sister, who already had the Kindle 7. For the price the 8 is better. First the obvious. a inch more screen does make a difference and the HD makes reading and streaming alot clearer. Being able to add more storage with a micro SD card is a huge plus as well. This device includes a camera! And last at under 100.00 makes this a huge value for a great tablet. Excellent. Just as good as iPad with a fraction of the price. The Amazon Fire HD8 (2016 model) is a great tablet for the price; however, the Fire OS offers limited abilities to the user. Personally, I wish there were ways to mirror the screen to a tv without having to purchase a Fire TV streaming stick. Also, the inability to use the google play store is a major set back. If it weren\\'t for those two complaint, I\\'d give this tablet 4 stars. I really love the new shape and size of the kindle HD. My daughter uses it and can control it great. I\\'m loving this new fire, mainly because I didn\\'t fork out a couple hundred for it. My only beef is that magazines are formatted for the demensions of an iPad so don\\'t look great on this Love my tablet easy to work and have no problem with down loads.and lite weight. Works okay as a tablet and especially to access Amazon.No good as a general tablet as there are no Google apps available, such as Chrome, gmail, etc. I love this Kindle. I love the fact that you can use an SD card for more storage. Great job The device is priced just right to give as a gift for an 8 year old We have had a hard time with tablets and our 8 year old who has been down loading apps since she was around 3-4 years of age so far this tablet has survived everything except the constant draining of battery when used by her . I believe it depends on how you want to use it. I bought this for my young kids and they are loving it. They can do basic stuff like surf the internet, watch youtube and play some games. The only complaint that I have is that sometimes it does not charge, even if you have have it connected for the whole night. You just have to restart the pad so that it can charge, but that is the only glitch. Works well. I really like the bigger screen (up from the 7\"). Easier to read, just as easier to use if not better. This tablet is great for anyone who uses this for the basics.Load times can be a bit slow for browsing the web or streaming videos, but once it\\'s loaded, it plays without buffering as long as you got internet speeds that are good enough. This tablet is a good size and great for pictures, downloaded videos and music. For its price, it makes a pretty good gift for someone wanting their first tablet. Bought one for the kids to use while we travel, lots of good free games. Installed VLC media player from the app store and filled up the SD drive with movies. Now they are nice and quite for hours on end.Battery life is awesome! Can\\'t beat the value on this. 5 stars even though it has less apps than the play store. I bought my Fire HD8 as an alternative to carrying around my laptop and having to buy many textbooks for college. The fact that I saved well over $150 on one of the 5 books I had to get this semester was a godsend. Most all undergraduate courses I have seen are offered in eBook form for Kindle. If you do not care about having the constant ability of being on the internet without WiFi or other hotspot, it\\'s a great resource. Pros:Price for this was still less than the money saved for my Biology Book.A lot less weight that 5 college textbooks.So far all books I need for college are available as eBooks through Amazon.A single charge can make it through an 8 hour school day.Cons:If you want/need a network connection, you have to use your phone as a hotspot or connect to another WiFi network. Bottom line, I wanted a cheaper alternative to having to lug over $750 in books around. I came out at well under $500 considering I bought this. My only disappointment is the inability to download some of the apps I use in my phone. I had the previous model which was fine for reading but a little slow for other things. The extra .5 RAM makes a difference. Very happy and if you\\'re a Prime member there are lots of freebies! I like this tablet. It has everything you want. However the apps within it need to be updated more often. If this happened than it would be top above an iPad mini. For now, it gives me enough of what I need and in HD. For $89 it was a good deal. Great inexpensive tablet for everyday use. It\\'s not powerful enough for super graphical games but it\\'s great for basic apps like surfing the web, emails, news, etc. Amazon has \"underground\" apps which is totally free (including in-app purchases). Only downside with those is that you sometimes see a full screen ads in them (usually products that\\'s on your Amazon wishlist). All-in-all, it\\'s a great tablet that you don\\'t have to worry about if you break it. Great price of 89 dollars on a great tablet. It is very fast at everything accept game play. For example it plays asphalt 8 and the game is just barely playable. The graphics struggle on this tablet with higher graphic games. Also it is a Amazon tablet with no Google play store but you can load Google play on to it. There are great you tube videos on how to put Google play on a amazon tablet. The screen is good as long as the sun isn\\'t hitting it. The stereo speakers sound great and loud. All in all I really liked the tablet for the price but I really like to play games with good graphic quality. So that being said I did return this tablet and ordered the Nvidia Shield 8 inch tablet through Best Buy for 199 dollars. I got the Shield a week ago and WOW!! What a difference in graphic gaming quality. This thing is just as good as an Xbox1 or ps4. The Nvidia Shield tablet is simply unbelievable for the price of 199 considering the Apple or Samsung tablets that are as fast as this tablet are at least twice the cost. Plus this dubbles as a gaming console for xbox or pc games with 4k out to you tv. The Amazon tablet is also a great tablet for normal usage but if your a gamer like me the Nvidia tablet is the tablet of choice hands down period!! I don\\'t know why bbuy kind of hides the Nvidia tab only on their website and doesn\\'t sell it in the store. If they displayed it in the store. This would outsell the Apple or Samsung tablets. I hope this helps thanks. I find this fire much lighter and very easy to use I use this primarily as a reader; however, it has a smaller number of unread books that are not in the familiar \"carousel\" as in other Kindle readers. As a tablet it is faster, brighter and more clear than other tablets that I have used for internet purposes. I would recommend this product to anyone who uses a tablet or a reader. Does great on browsing and doing research easy to use and love the features especially the private browsing a great price as well Great little tablet for a great price. I keep it at work for listening to music or some lunchtime reading. Wanted to travel without my laptop. Found the Fire to be perfect. Used it mainly for checking email and keeping up with Facebook posts of friends. Found the size of screen to be easy to read. Typing a tad uncomfortable until one has some experience using it. Have yet to use as an ereader. great tablet to replace kindle. Love the features. This is a great tablet for my teen. She loves it and the price can\\'t be beat! This is a great tablet. It has amazing storage. I use mine daily. Great for reading, surfing the web and games. The one small thing I don\\'t like is Amazon prime shows are a bit dark for some reason. Hulu and Netflix work wonderful. The kindle is great to read on. I also like that you can play some games. I love the amazon tablet very much and love to use its good performance and highly recommended to amazon users I bought this for my wife to replace her 7\" fire that was having a hard time holding a charge anymore. She is thrilled! It was easy for her to transfer all of her books and apps from her old fire to this. She mainly uses this for books , email and some games so this is the perfect tablet for her. better graphics and quicker with the 16gb storage If you don\\'t want or need something cheaper than an iPad but of quality, this is a great happy medium.The processor makes for a fluid ride with it. It\\'s speedy. The Android Store gives you good app options and the Amazon ecosphere is everywhere here.The software is a touch buggy but it\\'s still a great deal of a tablet.For a child, for something you want to use casually on a dime, it\\'s recommended. Easy to read. Light in weight. Has many good features. I read about this new 8\" Amazon tablet in the New York Times. My Google Nexus 7, 4 years old, was getting slower and slower, and I needed to upgrade - for as little money as possible.This Amazon Fire 8\" is an excellent value for the money(only $89!) - very fast, great screen resolution, and easy to use. I was skeptical of the Silk browser, which I\\'d never heard of, but it works fine. There is no \"page forward\" arrow, which is odd, only backwards, but I can live with that.It has exceeded my expectations and I\\'m very happy with it. I\\'m not in the Amazon ecosystem, this is my first foray, and it\\'s a good one! Congrats to Amazon for making an affordable, great quality tablet!Also, the purchasing experience at Best Buy was easy and convenient, as always! The new Fire HD 8 is an improvement over the Fire HD 7\". It is faster and the larger screen makes reading books much easier. I do wish the screen was easier to read when outside or in the car. Too much glare in those places. Love it! I\\'m not computer savy but was able to figure out most things without any help. Mother needed something since her tablet had died. Was lot easier for her to learn than her old table. She does lots more with Kindle than she did with tablet Light to carry and good picture quality. This was purchased for a hearing impaired person to download video in American Sign Language . This product was easy to maneuver for someone that was not use to a tablet. I love this tablet. I purchased them for gift and am so glad I did! The new Fire HD 8 tablet is a nice upgrade over the previous version. Storage doubled to 16 GB and the RAM increased by 50% to 1.5 GB. This makes the tablet faster and more responsive. With the improved battery life and much lower price, this is a great general purpose tablet. I purchased it for my dad (70)He needed something easy to use. He really enjoys it. It a great product..,. The quality is awesome the pictures is good and clear... i have had not issues with my purchase. i found a great cover for it on line on amazon and use it every night. thank you for your service. This has a great picture, good size, lots of storage and a camera. Would recommend I went from the 7 inch Kindle to the 8 and it really made a difference. Easier to read and clearer than my old one. I love this Tablet. It\\'s easy to use, a great price & lightweight. This is my second Kindle Fire HD. I was satisfied with the first one, but now I\\'m really enjoying the larger screen. My biggest need is to preserve the progress I\\'ve made in various games without having to replay them, but at least I have access to all my books, movies and games. Love the Kindle! Love the product. I use it every day for Web,Games and reading. I bought this to replace my wife\\'s (1st generation) Kindle Fire. She likes it even better than the old one, especially the pinsharp screen. Great Kindle fire, works great for reading, playing games, etc. Highly recommend to everyone. Very pleased with this device. Great price, easy to use, and light weight. Nice upgrade from my old kindle. I like it very much. For the price this is perfect. I read books, search the web, watch Netflix. It\\'s not an iPad but for the price it is amazing! İt is cheap tablet option coming from amazon. Latest model will satisfy your needs Very descent for a non-IPAD. Good speakers. Great price. The screen is a little dark. Great buy if you have Amazon Prime since you can download stuff and watch it offline (great for trips, etc...). Overall great cheap IPAD or even as a back-up tablet. Terrific battery life too. This thing looks nice, runs nice and feels nice and for the price I don\\'t think you can find a better tablet. Got this for my 9 year old after her ipad crashed and burned. She does not like androids at all but I couldn\\'t afford a expensive tablet for her. So we took a chance with this one. She is pleased and I\\'m pleased it seems so sturdy , not cheap quality at all. Going to get our youngest child one now. Very pleased. The quality of display is better than expected for the price. (Keep in mind that this is not an iPad!). Apps from amazon are well integrated and the functionality is fully enjoyable without limitation. Very satisfied with the product. This review is for Fire HD 8, 16 GB. I like it but I had a hard time figuring things out.Do I get to talk to geek squad free? Can I come down to the store and get someone to help me with my questions.Will there be a fee for that service? Beautiful HD resolution on this tablet. Love the 8\" size, not too big nor too small. This is an awesome tablet, fast, great display and has all the apps I need for personal entertainment If you look for a great tablet for entertainment this is the best you can have, if you want a tablet for working applications this is not the one so be aware and buy this tablet if you want tons of entertainment. also it have a larger processor and internal memory and the external memory to keep all your photos is unbelievable I strongly recommend it, again, not for work but for entertainment. I bought 2, 1 for each kid. Easy to set up and figure iut. I went with the staff member\\'s recommendation and I am so glad I did. I love the internet safety organ on it through Amazon. $2.50 a month per kid for unlimited age related and child safe Internet access and movies, books, games and apps and I can set the time it shuts off and a minimum time for them to read each day. Love love love. Good tablet, great price, easy to use, pick up simple Very happy with my kindle. Would buy it for my kids I am a power user; there\\'s no other way of putting it. I work in IT and I research the heck out of products before I buy. I had an iPad Mini 2 that was just not up to snuff with iOS 10 so I sold it and bought (and eventually returned) the 2016 Fire HD 8. First let me say it\\'s a great tablet for the price and for probably 50-60% of tablet users who surf the web and watch Netflix. It also helps if you are a heavy Amazon content user. For me, I was spoiled by the retina display on the iPad. The 720p display is alright, but you can see the pixels. 189ppi is pretty low by today\\'s standards. The other big thing for me was the lack of a laminated display. It\\'s glare city on this thing. Display nitpicks aside, it punches above its price point. If you don\\'t play really heavy games (which it even plays Titan Quest surprisingly well!) and you don\\'t mind not having an absolutely beautiful screen I think it runs and works fine. It just wasn\\'t for me. I bit the bullet and went with a 128GB iPad Air 2 as its on special at BB for super cheap right now. This is not a bad product. Amazon offers greats products but this tablet was missing features even for a basic tablet. The lack of google chrome compatibility made this tablet not right for me. So I got my Fire HD 8 originally for ebooks since e-copies are much cheaper. Very easy to use, especially if you are not tech friendly. So glad I got this. This was a good tablet. I bought it for my Gf who basically only wanted it for Netflix and YouTube. The display was good, not great. The issue we had was that it kept dropping the wifi connection. This could have been a defect in this one tablet but we returned it and got another one. Bought the Kindle for my daughter. It\\'s the 4th we have bought over the years, one for each child. Great product GREAT value for the cost - not as fast as a high end tablet, but certainly faster than I was expecting. Clear viewing and easy navigation Husband loves the 8\" tablet. The screen is big enough to view what he is reading For first tablet I am pleased. An amazon name is good value. Excellent price point for my basic requirements. It has all the features I need for comfortable reading of online novels and articles. This is a good product for the price. Many more things can be done with this fire 8 than we dreamed about. Easy access to my Amazon account. Easy to set up and use. This item has a very nice readout, and is well built as far as I can tell. The overall size is very suitable, and the price was reasonable. I get great service at Best Buy every time I shop there. Does everything I needed and moreI use it as a travel companion and the size is great. Its so perfect for my niece & she loves it. Going to get another one for my son. the performance is so much faster than my old one and the graphics are much better too. Love my kindle it does everything I wanted I to do. I wanted a tablet that was easy to use that I could access my email, internet and stream shows/movies! It\\'s perfect! As expected. I am very happy with this. This serves the purpose Handy to use and size is good. It\\'s light weight and that\\'s important. I got this for my husband birthday and he loves it This kindle is great. Battery lasts much longer than old kindle. Where do I begin...good clarity, I love the size and storage capacity! Very affordable, love watching Netflix on it. I do wish I could have gotten the purple, got the color black, but overall I\\'m very happy with my purchase. I didn\\'t think to much of it at first glad at the store, I decided to purchase it. IT WAS THE BEST DECISION EVER MADE I bought the Fire HD 8 & CaseI use it mostly for class..works very good..would be better if it had BlueTooth. We have several kindles and this is the latest version. Its packed with Amazon marketing stuff which is fine if you use them but most just take up space for us. This new version comes with 16gb but allows you to expand the memory with an sd card which is great. One problem if you have a few other kindles is that they are linked to your account so if they are for different family members/kids they may end up with the same stuff on them. My kids mainly use them for game apps and YouTube videos which am seem to work great. The sound is good and the hd video is nice. Overall happy with it and the price was good for this type of tablet. I went into Best But to buy another reader but ended up buying a Fire 8; good value and has the things I need in a reader. Got the tablet for my grandson he\\'s happy with it and use it as we speak We bought this earlier on line from another vendor and it was never delivered. Best Buy was great. Great buy. Bought it for my 10 year old niece. She loves it. I have always gone to buy a kindle because I like the books and th games available. But I found them very unpredictable and unreliable. The color burns futon screen, then the screens starts jumping. As a result I have purchased 8 over the years. Not sure if Want to go through that for the 9th time! It\\'s good, saves using up data usage on computer. I use it to keep up to date with the news. The Kindle Fire HD has a larger screen (8\" vs. 7\") and images are crisper with more vibrant colors. Just lock the card out and let the kids go crazy!! This is an awesome tablet perfectly for watch tv for my little nephew My kids enjoy reading books and playing games on the fire tablet. I\\'m so glad i brought this because it is very handy and easy to use too. Everything about it is good and I really like it. At the price it is almost an impulse buy. I wanted a tablet for an upcoming trip to watch some movies, read, etc and this was at a price point that made the decision really easy. If you are used to an iPad, the Fire HD is a little disappointing but it costs considerably less. It fit my needs but I felt some slugginess and several instances of needing to reboot to get certain apps to work correct. If you go in with the understanding this isn\\'t an iPad replacement this should fit the bills for you. Let\\'s just say, after my trip I purchased an iPad Pro and this item will likely be handed off to one of my children. If you have Amazon Prime, you do get some nice perks that make this a really nice item. Easy to follow directions allowed her to set it up with me watching over her shoulder. I purchased this tablet for my Autistic child. He loves it!! I\\'ve enjoyed using my Fire HD8 tablet to play games. Beautiful screen, vibrant color, fast and best quality for the money. I use it for downloading and reading books. It is the perfect size for this purpose. It is also very light. Bought for wife who is not into the techie word. She likes it - suggest buying a protective screen and padded case for it. My wife wanted an iPad. I bought her this because it was cheaper and good for reading and playing games. She uses iOS products so it\\'s not compatible. She hardly ever uses it. Next time I\\'ll get what she wants and not waste my money. Much better screen resolution than my 7 inch fire. I bought this tablet for my Mom and she loves it. I used it myself and it\\'s very easy to use and works nicely with Amazon Prime, etc. definitely would recommend especially for the price. I enjoy using the tablet. I use it when I am biking. This really a nice tablet.It runs great and it\\'s thin and easy to hold. This tablet is quick and as good as my iPad! I use the tablet specifically for one aspect of my life and it performs great! I am pleasantly surprised by its performance! I have a 4 year old boy and 6 year old girl and 12 year old boy no cracks or broken yet yes they have dropped them no case but no cracks yet pretty amazing when they drop it on hard wood floors and still not broke!! Wow I\\'ve had quite a few different kindles over the years and I\\'ve loved all of them. But this kindle fire hd 8 is by far my favorite. So glad my husband bought it for me the best purchase ever. Upgraded from a standard Fire tablet. Better screen, a bit faster than standard Fire. In my opinion this the absolute best value on a tablet out there. No way to go wrong at this price the new sound and the faster speed plus other improvments are great I am very happy with this Amazon tablet. I purchased it for business purposes, as well as recreational, and it works great for both. I did get an SD card for more memory. Also, if I would have bought directly from Amazon, there would\\'ve been a 1 month wait. However, I was able to order from Best Buy online, and pick it up that very day!!! Its perfect to see my tv series when i don\\'t have my tv around. It has a very good resolution quality. I bought the 8\" to replace my old 7\". I love the bigger screen Freeze frequently... No way to trouble shoot or repair it... I got myself 1 of these tablets and so far I love the way it works You can enlarge the print and change the lighting to make it easier to read. The only thing with it is you must have an Amazon account to use it. This kindle rocks! Tons of storage at an awesome price. bought it as a gift for my mother and she loves it I love the fire....it works great and the navigation through the Fire is user friendly too. I think the 8 is the better buy for your money. BY FAR THE BEST TABLET IVE EVER OWNED, EASY AND QUICK SET UP This tablet is very good especially considering the price. also has memory slot to increase storage. I bought this tablet over the holidays when it was on sale. It has been a great tablet. The battery life is great on these new models. Also playing games everything moves smoothly since it has more ram. The durability of the tablet is great. This thing won\\'t break if you drop it. The only thing I don\\'t like is the fire os. You can\\'t get everything you can get on the google store so not all apps are available. I have had a few kindle\\'s in the past so this was nothing new for me but what I loved about this one is that the screen is big so when I am reading a book it\\'s a lot easier than when I had the first kindle screen. I mostly use it just for the reading but being able to navigate the internet on it is great for when I want to look something up about the book real quick or if you want to search reviews on a book before purchasing. I love it! Purchase this tablet during the Christmas sale. This tablet is a good tablet for a beginner. Easy to use and shows movies and videos very well. Great tablet for on the go. Good size screen to watch movies or read book. Light, portable and great features. Highly recommended. For the price and features offered on the tablet, I wouldn\\'t purchase any other tablet. I enjoy using it and overall find it fairly easy to navigate. Easy internet browser with \"Silk\" and convenient access to all the applications I am interested in. Bought it for a friend he likes it.would recommend it. This tablet was everything I was looking for: a cheap tablet that could download Netflix shows for offline viewing Unlike my first Kindle, this tablet gives me all kinds of information, advertisements and offers when I first turn it on. I could live without that, but overall, I am pleased with this new tablet. It does many things I haven\\'t taken the time to explore, but hope to soon. This is a great tablet for the price. Would give it 5 stars if it had included some sort of instruction manual. Otherwise, definitely recommend. This is a great tablet with great features. I love my kindle. Can\\'t beat the price on this tablet! Great for streaming or casual games. Great for reading and Netflix. Fits nice in purse. Good price. Good value at a very affordable price. Can\\'t beat it. Works great prety fast operating system dosent heat up We love this so much in our home. We bought a super tough case and let our two and six year old use it. They love watching their movies on it and playing different apps. It is a really good value! Great tablet! Brought this for my wife and she loves reading off of it! Great price, easy to use! Great purchase! Very fast, very functional. Love the e-reader function. Movies, music and internet work great. LOVE IT! I received this as a gift from my husband. It\\'s great for reading, gaming and watching Netflix. I exchanged a highly unsatisfactory Insignia unit for the Fire. I was looking for a 10 inch screen, but went to the smaller size for performance. I have no complaints with the Amazon product, other than the ubiquitous advertising. My daughter loves her tablet. I had to make sure I brought a case because it is very thin. No problems and I can see everything she downloads Have a fire 7 and wanted a bigger screen, love the new one. Perfect for our needs and an on the go mini computer and ereader. This tablet is great for books, audible books, music and all things Amazon. The included browser (Silk) is not the best. I purchased expanded memory (64GB SD card) for about $30 more and a cover for about $20. The biggest issue I have with this unit is that it is slow (when compared to an iPad) and it tends to freeze every so often. For about 2.5x more money, consider an iPad instead. Great tablet use it for reading and email. Great price! Nice little tablet. Functional and easy to use.Fits the needs that I need to use it for. Awesome.and repeat 50 times. That should do it. Blah. I initially bought the tablet for school, I use Kindle to rent books but after using it to stream Xfinity, Netflix, and Amazon Prime I loved the sound and picture quality. I would recommend this to anyone needing a good low cost tablet with great battery life. We have had no issues with this tablet. Love it!TY For the price it\\'s a bargain. This is a perfect solution for a reader and simple browsing. I use this at night before bed. My first tablet experience and it\\'s awesome. I love being able to stream movies and have numerous apps at my fingertips. Bought this for my wife and she loves it! This was our third kindle over a period of many years\\'Can\\'t go wrong for the price. Love this tablet. Power lasts long. Short charge time. HD screen is really clear. Only con is that there are some apps not available like Google play. Very satified. Have a 128gb card in mine . Plenty of space for downloads. The camera has no flash and is not the best but I didnt buy this tablet for that. High recommend the HD tablet 8gb amazon fire. You want go wrong. This tablet does all the things I really need. I have it some thought before buying I don use most of the features a more expensive computer/tablet has. Have been very happy with my purchase. Got this for my wife\\'s birthday. She had an older model and wanted an upgrade. She seems very happy with it and uses it every day Very user friendly...long lasting battery....very clear display Worse graphics, won\\'t keep a wireless connection,overall not satisfied Easy to transfer my stuff from my old Kindle into this new one. Love the price and how easy it is to use. Great buy. This is my first kindle. It works great for my use. Mostly reading, email, and Amazon shopping. Amazon Fire HD8 is one of the best deal at 89$. Strong, efficient, low price and some Amazon features that I love. Youtube videos of how to get googleplay and android apps have made things lot more easier. And now, microsoft office is available online for free that I can access and edit my documents. What else do I need? Amazon is more respectable brand name than other low price brands or used/old models of high price brands. Definitely recommend it. I held off getting a tablet and wish I had done it sooner. The Amazon Fire 8 is great and easy to use i have been looking at tablets for a long time, most of them a little expensive for what i would use it for. This tablet lets me read, email, searches and the best part I can buy books through amazon and not have to carry heavy books with me when i travel Not the highest quality of tablet out there, but for the price you almost can\\'t beat it, especially if you are an Amazon Prime member. I liked the screen size and easy to read books at night. The battery has a long life. The outer rcase could be stronger because concerned about durability. Works great for everything we want our daughter to do it\\'s wonderful. I love it. It\\'s easy to watch movies, play games and read books. love it just like my other one just better!!! since I already own a kindle I knew this was what I wanted. Just needed a second one and a little bigger. Always loved the service and help I get at BB so I knew I would purchase it there!! Found salesman to be knowledgeable and most helpful. Thanks so much for your help and service New Kindle replaced my old Kindle that had a lot of books. To my surprise the book transfer worked well. Seems to work surfing the net. Music sound is only okay. Great little device that does almost everything a Tablet does. I use it as my computer when I travel as well as a reader. Has meet all my needs plus some. Recommend you buy a good stylus pen at the same time. It fits just right in your hand. Light weight. Love it I extremely happy with my purchase. I like that the screen is just a little bigger and much faster. Good picture, works well, great variety of apps. keep in mind that you get apps from amazon, not google play, so they aren\\'t always the same or same price This replaced my old Kindle Fire. I have not yet explored all of the features but, so far, it is performing very well. Tablet is a good size and weight, and easy to use. This tablet has been the best one for the price we have purchased 3 other tabs for our kids and they have all broke and ran super slow they love them would definitely recommend this to anyone who wants to save a buck but want quality I would recommend this product it is a good tablet to use have had no problems. Kids love it, under $100 so the price is great. Don\\'t have to worry about it getting mishandled as much. Still can\\'t get them off the ipad though. I went with this tablet based on many good customer reviews, but my experience was not a good one. From the start I was on the phone every day for at least an hour with Amazon tech support for one issue or another. Most of the techs were very polite, but not all knew the product very well. At one point I asked one of them about trying to save some RAM and they kept referring me to the storage, which told me they didn\\'t even know the difference between RAM and regular storage. The internet browser was basic and it ran very slow at times, even when all my other wifi devices ran great. Then a day would pass and I\\'d be trying to type an email and the keyboard would just stop working...wtf??? Come to find out it\\'s a \"known issue\" and \"they\\'re working on it\". After two weeks of one thing after another I got fed up and just returned it. I wanted it to work, and gave it a good run, but just not quality stuff. To me it was like Walmart trying to build their own computer when they\\'re obviously not a computer manufacturer, neither is Amazon. If I were you I\\'d look at a regular Android tablet from a reputable PC manufacturer, which is exactly what I did next. I got an ASUS tablet for only a few dollars more, and it\\'s unbelievable. 1000% better in comparison to the Amazon Fire HD8. Save yourself the aggravation and go with ASUS or some other company that is specifically in the computer business full time. Sorry Amazon, not this time! Not very fancy, but not slow. If you have Amazon Prime, you have a access to a great library of TV shows and Movies for free. Same goes for free book rentals. The Amazon App store is not so great, lots of apps are outdated but still work. Just not the latest versions you would expect. But the Amazon Underground appstore does offer free access to games you would normally pay for. It\\'s decent for it\\'s price and a good deal if you don\\'t want anything fancy. I love my Kindle fire. Had a Kindle and it disappeared. Enjoy not having to go to library for books. I get a great selection of books every day. Light weight and easy to use. Very user-friendly. Durable. For the price the tablet can not be beat. I use this over my ipads that i have. There is nothing i cant do with this tablet I recently upgraded to this tablet; it is everything I wanted. Highly recommend! It was a good buy and tried this for a day. It was fast and experience was good. I purchased this tablet knowing exactly what my needs were and how well the Kindle could meet them. Despite the \"walled garden\" philosophy that tethers you mostly to Amazon products and services, the ability (as of right now) to side-load the Google Play Store makes this a surprisingly versatile device for the price point. This is a great tablet for the price! I bought it to replace my iPad mini. Great for ereading and general browsing. This replaced a Kindle 7 HDX with 32GB of ram. The older tablet had a charging port that wasn\\'t functioning anymore. Had the Geek Squad warranty so they issued a full credit for the old tablet and my son chose the HD8 as his new tablet. Other than the screen resolution being lower and less memory, great tablet. My son didn\\'t care about the resolution and the new Kindles let you pop in an SD card for more storage. Popped in a 64GB SD card and he\\'s a happy camper now.. ;) I purchased this as a gift but have had extensive time with it. It\\'s a great budget tablet, phenomenal screen and a very smooth interface. Handles all apps and HD content well. This was a birthday gift to my husband. He really likes it and it does what he needs it to do I \"retired\" an earlier version and this new souped up model more than meets my needs, and the battery lasts so much longer!! I have a kindle and wanted more options. I love the bigger screen. I find it easy to read. It can have some reflection under lights but not much. This tablet is easy to set up, has great resolution, and is perfect for reading books or surfing. The price is affordable, too. It is perfect for anyone who wants a fun and casual way to use technology. This was bought to replace my old Kindle with keypad, and experimental internet. Was surprised how much the Kindle had changed, and at the same price as my old one was when I bought it!Have already shown it to a couple of friends who now say they are thinking about getting one. Really enjoying my new tablet. I like to travel and me and my family use it to play game and watch movies. Just the right size to. Liked this Kindle upgrade. The color screen and backlights allowed for easy night use I enjoy the new kindle, only things I would like to change is the way screen darkens and lightens while reading. Not sure how to stop that. Occurs consistently. Also, would like to stop the ads seen each and every time kindle is turned on to start reading again. That is bothersome. Otherwise, am happy with the kindle. I purchased the 8 inch device. Also purchased black cover.I played for it and asked if I could get it set up and was told it would be 40 more dollars. I did not have 40 more dollars so I left the store with my kindle and had someone else set it up for free. I was disappointed I had to get someone else to set up my kindle. My previous Kindle was dying and I wanted a new replacement fast. I went to Amazon and while they had one it was back ordered a month. Expecting to pay more I went to Best Buy and not only found it for the same price but even better it was available at my local store and I could pick it up the same day! I got this for my son to play games on soI could get my iPad back. Personally I think it\\'s a great little tablet for kids and or for reading. Other then that it\\'s not a high powered game playing tablet or anything to keep lots of storage on. But it works for what it\\'s intended for andI have no problems. Easy to use You cant beat it for the price you pay This Kindle is larger than my old one and book reading is much easier. Some features I don\\'t use so can\\'t comment on them. All in all I love it.The only drawback was that the store had no covers that fit this Kindle. We purchased this as a replacement for our now-broken iPad. Though we liked the smaller size (more convenient, easier to carry, etc), the internet was sooooooo slowwwwww that it drove us crazy. Sometimes minutes to download a site (and this with no other apps open!1). Plan to go back to another iPad. Tablet is great and easy to use thankfully because its my 1st tablet This is an item that is easy to use for novices. My child uses it and has no issues Easy to use. Pretty user friendly. It is good value for the price No problems with tablet, kids love it and the size is great My nephews love to play with my phone. Now as anyone who has been around small humans knows they have an astounding ability to perpetually have something sticky on their hands. However, if its a rare case where they don\\'t they will probably drop the device from the lack of said stickum. The kindel has come to my rescue as it has everything they need to be entertained. And best of all it lacks the anxiety inducing price tag for that moment when the kids demonstrate Murphy\\'s law in action. Was a present for my 14 year old grandson. He was very pleased. The Kindle fits me to a \"T\". Very quick to start. It shows how to get things done. For under $100 this 8\" tablet is a bargain. I do all I want on it like; check email, Facebook, Twitter, watch YouTube, read books, and shop on eBay or Amazon. I\\'ve been very pleased with my purchase. Bought this for my wife for our anniversary she loves it I love to read and this tablet work great for my needs. I know beforehand that this is not a powerful tablet. But it\\'s the best bargain at this price point . The screen is okay if you just read books, news, or surf the websites. But if you want to enjoy videos-this is not your choice.The processor is slow and the amazon app store doesn\\'t have all the apps like you\\'d expect from Google appstore- even though the OS based on android. But few tweaks let you install the Google playstore-search online for the steps.Overall I\\'m satisfied with my purchase. Hope this is helpful. I bought it for my grand daughter, she knew how to use it right away. You can purchase a rubber case in different colors for protection. It is just an average tablet. Bit slow but is a good option for people on budget Very nice for reading and watching videos. Strong wi fi is a must. Slippery to hold so buy a cover Tablet stopped working after owning for two weeks. Came back on after an hour. This device is great for the price! I use it for my daughter and after having seeing the ads on amazon, I thought this would perfect for her. I think that the Amazon Kindle tablet was a great purchase for my teenage daughter and grandson, very easy to operate. It kept them entertained for hours while we were traveling on the train for vacation. Great device. Works very well and use it throughout the day.Keeps me informed and great for looking up things and staying in contact. I love my kindle, I can listen to music,read my emails, or pick a book to read. Everything loads up easily. I really enjoy my new kindle, still getting used to it. I have done this like 5 times now. Don\\'t send me this ahs8n. Getting aggravating. This is an affordable tablet and works well, you just have to deal with a lot of advertising. Love how I am able to run the latest Minecraft on this device, but am not able to on a 3-year-old iPad. It seems as apple handy cap their devices. Resolution may not be the best, but for the little buggers it works fine I love my Fire HD8 I got it because my Kindle(the original) that my husband bought me died and the Verizon Tablet wasn\\'t working great for me. So I came down and the agent at store showed me this one, there is a learning curve but it gets better and takes a while to learn but I love it. Does all the basic stuff I need at a great price. I use it for some apps, web browsing and some video. Picked this over the Fire 7\" for the screen size, resolution and CPU/GPU. Battery life is pretty good. Ads aren\\'t too annoying.Far cheaper than competing name-brand budget tablets while doing almost everything needed at this level and probably better supported. FireOS will always be a little behind the current Android version and I\\'d rather have Google Play than Amazon, but this still allows for side-loading stuff.Recommend if you\\'re ok with living in Amazon\\'s world and/or proficient enough to load other app stores or packages (or know somebody can). this item work just as I expected it to, great product! This is the third Fire we\\'ve purchased, and Amazon finally made this level memory-upgradable. That has made all the difference. I bought Fire tablets for use as a \\'kid tablets\\', for which they work great...until you run out of memory. 8GB is practically nothing these days (I remember when having 64kb was a HUGE upgrade to my Atari!) so being able to toss in a memory card give my kids much more utility. Have a nook , this is much better has more apps and thru amazon I love the size and the HD quality. Just what I was looking for!Downloads apps really fast! Never thought a tablet at this price could be this good. Totally recommended! This is my sixth unit and has features many of the newer models didn\\'t have. Thank.............................................. I had the original kindle fire for ten years and I loved it. But it broke on me and I decided on this one after looking at all the upgrades from the original. It let\\'s you do so much more, but some of the tutorials (like for the internet) weren\\'t helpful. Lightweight, nice display and not too large to carry. this is the perfect size for an older person who uses it minimally. Good tablet, satisfied. One point annoying...silk browser makes Yahoo email a list and have to tap HTML to read each one...Awkward. I love the apps that are on here and everything else I think it\\'s the perfect tablet for a beginner has all of the apps that you will need Love this tablet. 16GB memory but have expansion slot. Bought 128GB micro SD card for $56. Love this feature I love Amazon Fire HD8... It is so easy to use and perfect for reading books on or cruising Social Media. I love that it has Alexa included on it. I love my Kindle for reading manga and comics. The fact that the graphics are worse than my phone detracts a little from the expirence, but serves to remind me that I cheaped out and bought yesterday\\'s model. This is not a real negative, it just appeares less crisp than my phone. The increased picture size more than makes up for it in my book. This thing lasted not even a month before it went dead. Going to try and take it back Bought this so the grandkids could use it. They already have one at their house. My husband has been using it also & he likes it. He has never used a tablet before but he has enjoyed it. This is a fantastic tablet for the price. This is a great alternative to an IPad. I had an original Kindle that I replaced with this newer one. I love it!! My 8 year old loves this so much to do on it. She enjoys reading on it play games . I purchased this tablet for my 9 year old son and he loves it. Nice bright screen and has two speakers for pretty good sound for a tablet. Great for games and watching videos. This was purchased on Black Friday as an impulse buy and we absolutely love it! It was a great price and the size of the tablet is perfect. It works great! Great little tablet for someone who is always on the go. I love my tablet no regrets the pic are great I recommend it! It\\'s a great item to have when you are out and about. It\\'s easy to connect to Wi-Fi and it\\'s small enough to fit in my purse. Nice product for the price. It does what we need it to do. Easy to use and handy to have with you instead of a heavy laptop. This was a surprise when we opened it up! Bright and colorful!! Nice look. Great memory and camera. For this much money everything is so good. Bought this for my niece for Christmas. She mostly uses as ereader and checking email. I\\'m happy with my purchase is all I can say. The only complaint I have is that the 3.5 mm Jack is right next to the volume button and it gets in the way. Good tablet for the price. Nice display good performance. Loved my first kindle so the upgrade to the new one was practically seamless. This is I think the best product I\\'ve bought. I already own eight that I\\'ve purchased through the years for my family and they seem to only get better and less expensive in price. I have been completely satisfied with this product. The quality of graphics is great and downloads are a breeze. I would definitely recommend this product. I bought this as a present for a friend, and he uses it all the time. The HD screen is crystal clear, and this tablet competes well with the bigger names. My dad is a first time user for anything techie he has really enjoyed it. If you enjoy reading you will not find a better device. Excellent price for a product of this quality Bought this for my great granddaughter for a gift. She loves it and it is easy for her to use Was bought for a Christmas gift. My 11 year old son loves it. A friend of mine was in the market for a new tablet. I had researched the Fire tab for some time and liked the specs, which met her needs. I decided to buy her one for her b day, SHE LOVES IT! Works great with all the Amazon stuff, like Kindle, Alexa, etc. My kid enjoys the tablet. This one is inexpensive than ipad. The availability of apps are limited. I love my kindle, it is what I like to use at the end of the day or for business trips. The only annoying things are the amount of advertising the put on this version. It was only $35 for Christmas so I can\\'t complain. im always using my amazon tablet...perfect for games!!! Great price. Fantastic gift! I would recommend this for a gift for all ages. I love to read! Having the Kindle Fire is like having hundreds of books at my fingertips! Bought this as a Christmas present for my wife. Reads it all the time! Great all around tablet. Color and resolution is very nice. Best price for a nice product. Bought for my son as a birthday gift and as a way to not wear out his laptop. Works great especially for videos and general online use. This was an impulse buy. While getting a bigger, faster and much better tablet for my wife I decided I\\'d get this for myself. It did the job just fine, but after about a week I returned it. I just didn\\'t find myself using it wnough to warrant keeping it. The price is awesome and if you don\\'t mind it being a bit slower than other, much more expensive, tablets then I don\\'t think you can go wrong. I use this all the time. So much better than bringing out the laptop. This tablet is definitely recommended if you are looking for light to medium usage. Tablet is snappy and quick but slarts to lag after installing multiple apps.Amazon app store is good but there are few essential apps that are not available, though you can install them using black market. Nice it all ready has Amazon and apps built in. Great buy. Bought this tablet for my wife and she absolutely loves it. I also use it for school which works great with writing notes directly on PowerPoints So far so good. This is replacing a broken kindle fire. Bought this for my husband. He has really enjoyed it. Great for my son. I monitor school work and apps he downloads. I love my kindles. This is the 4th one. The others I wore out. I enjoy this one the most . Easier researching things , lot more options etc Very good value tablet. Does everything pretty well. Brightness isn\\'t great. Battery takes a while to charge but lasts forever. Decent buy. Would recommend. Really enjoy my kindle. Fits perfect in my purse and the screen is a good size. I bought this for Christmas for my husbandand now I \\'ve had it for months. I am still happy with this purchase. It has a nice screen and is easy to see what you are viewing. I will be buying another one for myself soon. I really like the feel and ease of use. It\\'s a great tablet for the price. This is a great tablet. I was surprised at how efficient and easy to use it is. I bought 8 of these for gifts to make Bible study easier for a bunch of friends. We purchased this for my wife\\'s mother. She likes to play games on it and do some reading. Needed a new Kindle. Wasn\\'t sure what one to choose. This one is GREAT! This product is OK but is not the best you can get. for a sale item fine. battery life seems to be a little short. Bottom line.....So so So far I am extremely satisfied with my purchase. Great product for a great price! I use this while underway and it\\'s a perfect size to travel with Love it. Great gift. Awesome for those who don\\'t have a tablet or never used one Works great with my amazon prime account and for browsing Internet and playing game. Cheap tablet as well. Had it for about a week and now it won\\'t take charge, tried new chargers and still not taking charge. Happy with tablet but unhappy about not chatging Overall I think the Kindle Fire HD is a great product. No complaint so far. I am extremely happy with my purchase. The kindle is very fast and the screen is clear. Great tablet, fast & reliable. Only downfall is having to pay to remove adds. It all of a sudden has stoped charging I have only used it a few times in the short time off purchase. Can I get a replacement or how best can I be helped The Fire HD8 tablet is so easy and fun to use. Take it everywhere. Love that it is easier to see than a cell phone, for those with old eyes. My wife\\'s mom wanted a tablet. This was a great way to get her into technology and she LOVES it. Not iPad or galaxy but good start. I purchased b/c my old kindle fire finally bit it ...screen went dark. Very happy with this one. Cost is great. The screen resolution is great. User friendly. My favorite feature is the SD card so you can add more gb. Bought it for my daughter. Works great Store personnel did an excellent job This is a reliable brand and a good product for price. Our son just LIVES this unit. He has all his favorite games on it. I bought this kindle for the extra size. I have recently been having trouble with seeing clearly so I figured with the size it may be easier. It was and I really like being able to change the color of the fonts and background, it seems to help immensely. Great budget tablet at a great price. Long battery life and high quality display. I traded this in after receiving a 7\" at Christmas and I am happy I did. I love the size of the screen for reading my books (which I have too many of) and a great size for watching movies. I do wish I had the capability to use internet when I am away from home, yet other than that, this is a great buy. Overall I like the Fire HD8 tablet, hard to beat at that price point. Sure the more expensive tablets are faster, brighter, better, but for the money and casual surfing it is just right. Good companion to Prime Membership, wouldn\\'t be half as good without. This is great tablet. Its great for people who don\\'t need a lot of apts. or store a lot on it. Doesn\\'t over heat. Light weight. I was going to get a Samsung tablet but for doing everything this is better amazon tablet is great. no google bloatware. everything is amazon. one thing i didnt like was. ads on the lock screen and no way to turn off. Bought this tablet to replace a 3 year old Galaxy Tab. This tablet is quick and easy to use, relatively streamlined. The screen is nice and the stereo speakers, while tiny, sound better than my old tablet. The modified Android system that Amazon is running on this tablet is good, just a bit restrictive. All in all a good tab for general browsing and popular apps.Pros:-Price-Performance-Feels sturdy-Easy to navigate-Silk browser works greatCons:-Not all apps are supported on here, like Telegram-Ads on lock screen feel unnecessary, but not a hindrance-Not as customizable as other Android tabs I needed to replace my old reader, and found that this model was just as good. if not better, and at a greatly lower price. I have enjoyed using it for about a month, and am very please with it. I didn\\'t expect anything less than what I got with this Kindle. Bought this for my daughter to replace a worn out ipad. She is happier with the size. The resolution is nice. Great buy for the price This tablet could be so much better if the apps actually worked decently. The built in Amazon pieces for Prime members is great and work flawlessly. But it\\'s not enough to overcome the terrible app behavior and countless freezes.  They need to take a lesson or two from Apple. I have only used this a few times so far, but I like it. The lightweight and pretty easy to navigate. Perfect screen size too. I ended up purchasing a second one for my fiancé. The size of this table is great I\\'m able to carry it in my purse with no problem! Really nice customer first service. I have had other Kindle readers before so was familiar with the unit. I bought this tablet mostly for watching movies. I downloaded movies from Netflix and watch them during indoor bike training at the gym. I love the ability to expand the memory with a microSD card, which iPads do not. It\\'s pretty fast and has all the features I need. I read kindle books with it as well. The drawback is that some apps are not compatible with this device. The iPad is definitely more powerful and compatible with many apps I use, but this is a great tablet for most of my current interests. Before the 8 inch kindle we the old 7 inch one, which both tablets are great but this one so much nicer. The screen is bigger, more storage amd Love the color on the back. Great Tablet I\\'m enjoying the longer battery life, faster processing and most of all the ability to expand the memory. Highly Recommended! She loves it . it\\'s the best thing we could of ever brought her Bought this tablet for my son and he has loved it. It\\'s so easy for him to use and easy for me to set parental controls. Nice little tablet for the money. A few ads to deal with. I use it to read books. Have read a lot of books on it. The right size and lighting for any situation. I bought this for my computer loving 89-year-old dad. Now he can check his emails from his chair rather than having to go into his computer room! Bought on Black Friday for $60, add a trifold case, portable TV while I do dishes/cook/anything Got this when it was on sale which is what really made it worth getting. Tablet works well, slim design is perfect. Highly recommended to purchase this tablet. Perfect purchase for me. I take it everywhere and is so easy to use! Purchased this a couple of weeks ago, no complaints so far. Web pages load pretty quickly on the Silk browser, and the battery life is excellent. After installing Google Play Store (it\\'s really easy!) even more apps are available. Can\\'t beat this for under a hundred dollars!!! After having a basic Kindle for 6 years, I moved up. I am thrilled with all this product can do. I am an avid reader. The Fire let\\'s me do that and lots of other things. I am still finding apps, and other things it will do. I know this sounds \"old fashioned\", but it would be great to have a user\\'s manual! Thanks for asking. Bought as a replacement kindle for my mother in law. She loves it perfect size for her. This is my 4 the Kindle and is well worth the price. My wife loves this tablet.Much easier to use than previous 2 tablets that we purchased. It\\'s great!! Light weight! Charges quickly! Great features! Will not seem to charge all the way and this is my 7th Kindlle. Nicer than my old fire. Better screen area to view My husband and I both use this and really love it. We got kindle unlimited for the books but it\\'s also great for playing games and surfing the web too. Love my new Kindle Fire - easy to use - the battery life is amazing!! Perfect size for reading watching movies and carrying on a plane I upgraded from a 7 to an 8 inch. What a difference. Totally satisfied would recommend this to everyone I know and it out performs some of the bigger name brand tablets out there. if you looking for a good video and somewhat customizable tablet at a great price do not pass this up. If you need a basic tablet then the fire works. It falls apart when compared to the iPad mini from a usability, functionality and available apps standpoint. Worked great but after awhile I wouldn\\'t unlock. After I\\'d enter my pin, the screen would go black. I took it to geek squad (luckily I bought the protection plan!) and told me they don\\'t fix them they just replace them. So I got another one but that one did the exact same thing. Ended up returning that one too. seems a lot better, does not have the open cover feature, which I miss, but still getting used to the differences and trying to get my thing back on that I had on the old 1 Really easy to use, nice size, works great, affordable price, extra card slot for storage, bright screen, good speakers, easy to download apps, This is my third Kindle. My sister bought me my first one and I said I didn\\'t need it and probably wouldn\\'t use it. I was so wrong! I use it everyday. When it died, I bought another one and then a third. I can\\'t live without a kindle. I bought the kindle fire 8 for my husband and I to use. Neither one of us have been able to figure out how to use it. Every time we open it advertisements pop up. And we just try buttons to remove it. We cannot get it to rotate for our puzzles. Just too complicated to use and to navigate around. I will be returning it. We have an iPad and it\\'s much easier. bought this for my niece and it works perfect, she easily navigates all menus and features... An inexpensive tablet that can satisfy your reading and viewing pleasure. Fast and good quality product. Recommended! Bought this for my 2 yr old. Easy to use. Good parental controls. As long as you\\'re not comparing it directly to an iPad, then it\\'s a pretty good tablet for the $$ like it at first, but it is going slow sometimes. overall good product We bought the tablet for our kid and it actually is good for her. Great little tablet to take with you, great for kids Only problem is that it is impossible to read or do anything on the KindleFire with any light in the room at all; far worse than impossible in sunlight. There should be some sort of temporary screen or other add-on that can be used with the device when in sunny or bright locations. I like this and the price is right enjoying it now I Bought this as a gift for my daughter! She is diabetic and losing her vision. I am hoping the large text will be easier for her to see so she keeps reading. I have ordered a couple of these for my family members and say that they work great and do everything that they are supposed too. Highly recommend. I have a nexus 9 but it is painstakingly slow so I wanted something that does not lag Everytime I try to use the browser and does not freeze whilst playing games and this gets the job done very well. The battery life is also very good. Highly recommended for casual browsing and games. Great tablet, only thing needed is a better camera. However, for the price, it can\\'t be beat. Lightweight, performant, and packed with features. This device is great for reading, music, or movies on the go as well as web browsing and email. Easy to use, like lighted screen for reading in dark Better than I expected for the price. Works good and I would fully recommend I am very satisfied with this product. It performs extremely well in all areas of its operation. We bought one of these for my daughter to help with her learning. There are so many possibilities with this. It\\'s way cheaper than an Ipad and does basically the same thing. I absolutely love my Fire tablet. Great size, lots of space and a great reader. I can\\'t recommend this product enough. I like this tablet, its thin, light and easy to use. It\\'s great for kids and adults as well. Have been pleased with my purchase of the Fire HD8 as it\\'s video quality is great when viewing ESPN3/Netflix/YouTube Tutorials.The ability to easily load and read my saved textbooks within the Amazon Kindle App is fantastic for a fraction of the price for an IPAD. : ) The first Fire HD8 we purchased died within 1 week of purchase. We had to go back and exchange it for a new one. Not a good sign so far. I I bought this for a friend since she liked mine so much.It is a great way to check emails and read Kindle e-Books.I keep an SD card in mine and store my books on it. You can just drop this in your purse to read on the go. Husband is a first time user, he is doing really well with it.. He has low vision problems and this made reading his favorite books a lot easier to read. It\\'s actually a very good product for a decent price. Not lightning fast but it is okay for everyday use. Love customer service very knowledgeable and helpful Very good tablet for the price economical and the ability to carry in backpack I bought this Kindle for my husband\\'s birthday. I have had a Kindle since 2013 and I used it mostly to read and check emails while travelling. My husband is not particularly a book reader, but he spends way too many hours alone, in his office, reading his face book messages. Now, with the new Kindle he actually multi-tasks, in the living room, on facebook, email, and internet, at least in proximity to me, so he might even join me in a conversation! I think his Kindle has much imporoved our 35 year marriage! It is easy to use. It was cheap. Have not found anything about it that I do not like. i really love this product because it lets me read books and surf the net Love this tablet. Bought it to be my touch screen remote for my harmony hub, but use it for so much more now. make sure you buy a micro sd card with at least 64 gb of memory. or you will have to constantly delete old items. This is a good product but the one I bought stops working after three or four typed sentences and the Geek Squad guy told me when I brought it back that I had to go into settings and clear the data when it does that. WRONG ANSWER. That should never have to be done. He had no idea what he was doing and North Haven Best Buy didn\\'t offer to fix or replace my Kindle. This is the third product I have had to go back and either return or exchange because it wasn\\'t working properly or at all. One manager tried to excuse the store by asking me if I understand Best Buy doesn\\'t actually manufacture these products. If that is the best they can do to explain why they, as the Point of Sale, keep selling defective products, the North Haven store has a big problem. like the speed the 8 inch screen is great. Works well. Up and coming new technology helps everyone to enjoy life more greatly This is the perfect tablet for my purposes. Easy to use and the perfect size. Not too large and not too small. This device is s really good piece of electronic. It is a good reader and also is very good for my 2 year old granddaughter to use. For my son as a present for college books. 5 textbooks were 1/4 the price on kindle than if we bought them on Amazon, this is my third kindle. Other two still working great, I bought this to replace a 7\"fire hd tablet that broke. Amazon changed the operating system so it took me a while to figure it out. I set this up for my son with special needs. I tried to make it as simple as possible for him. It is a little bigger. The sound isn\\'t as good as the previous fire tablet. It also seems very slippery. I got a rubber honeycomb type cover for it. That seems to help us to grip it better. Over all, it\\'s a good tablet for a child. Just use parental controls, and get a good cover for it. Reciever of this really likes and and says its a step up from the fire hd7, so I guess that is what counts. My bf got me this as a birthday present from my son. It\\'s just like my 7\" although larger. I cannot tell the different between the regular and the HD and I game on it. I\\'m not sure if it cost more, but wouldn\\'t waste the money if it did. Noticeable improvement over the fire 7 inch. If you\\'re a first-time tablet owner then the fire 7 inch is a great device. But if you\\'ve owned a tablet with higher specs, there is a noticeable improvement with the fire 8 inch . The Fire 8\" has a better display and faster processing. Very satisfied for $39.95 sales price. Way faster than I expected. I purchased this for a small child to use. She is quite happy with it, however it was a little too slow for my taste. My new Kindle is an upgrade from my 7 year old Kindle Fire. As to be expected the video quality is better along with faster performance and more features. I still use my old Kindle as it is still ticking but the \"shiny new toy\" is fun. This is the second Fire tablet that I have purchased. The first I returned in after I was not able to load YouTube onto the tablet. Amazon\\'s take on Android was just to unfriendly to make it work. With this new tablet, Amazon has heard my concern and now I\\'m enjoying this tablet. It\\'s well built for a sub-$100 device, but won\\'t stand up to a lot of abuse. Reliable, price efficient device. Easy to use for all ages. I can play games, surf the internet or watch movies. I can check my e-mail or just about do anything I can do on a regular computer.I strongly recommend it. This is a terrific tablet at a great price. The quality is excellent, the price is right, it has tons of storage capacity. And oh, did I mention that it\\'s cheap? (Cheap for a tablet, that is.) Had a great experience with my Best Buy rep! Great Job! Small, portable and very easy to use. I have not had any issues as of yet. I purchased this product on a whim with a very limited purpose which was to study for an exam while in the middle seat on a long flight. I expected to hand it to my 10-year old after my exam. The surprise was that really enjoy the device and in particular I like the Amazon account integration: On my next flight I was delighted to find that the unit actually downloads my videos for offline viewing! The best part is that I upgraded the memory with a 64GB SD card so now my available content is awesome! Truth is that my first unit inexplicably failed but Best Buy replaced my unit right away and I expect great things with this new device! My son also uses it on long trips!!! I bought the HD Fire 7 for my wife,I liked hers decided to buy the Fire HD 8 for myself I love it.Nice graphics easy to use. Able to download music and movies free!!!!!!!!!!!! I have used the Kindle mostly for reading. I have downloaded books from Amazon, some free some purchased, that I have heard about for years and now will read. I have also read Manga from the Internet. My use of the internet has also included looking up gardening hints, animal care, and dog breed characteristics. Need to have some computer savvy. Wound be much more helpful if it came with a simple basic instructions. This was a gift for my son and he loves it. It not only helps him with his homework but he could also play games on it! You cannot top the value at this price point with any other tablet. The only reason I give it 4 stars instead of 5 is the limited app selection through the amazon app store. If this came with the google play store, I would give it a 5 in a heartbeat. Overall it is a great tablet at this price point. I would highly recommend it. Great for my mom who isn\\'t tech savvy. Luv it! :-) Very smooth tablet no lag at all also good battery. Love the kindle will continue to buy them for my family awesomeness, love how i xan watch my xfinity movies This tablet is not only a great price but exactly what I needed for quick Internet access and to download books ! I purchased the Amazon Fire HD 8 to replace my 2nd generation Kindle Fire. It works great and the colors are sharp. The 8 is bigger and lighter weight than my old 7 and the battery life is longer. It also has more storage and a camera. Love it! I lost my tablet in Germany and wanted a replacement fast. Best Buy, had both the 7 and 8 inch Kindle fires in stock, after reading the reviews, I decided to go with the 8 inch. Boy was I glad that I did, the larger viewing area, is great for watching movies and Netflix on the airplane. The 8 inch has stereo sound , unlike the 7 inch which has only mono. Overall I am really happy with this tablet Pros - HD quality for low price. Works really well with my Amazon account to access multiple Amazon features with extreme ease. Couldn\\'t be happier. I have iPads too which are extremely versatile but they came with a big price but not this tablet. Love it! We bought this one and a black one for our kids. It\\'s very durable and good price for the quality. For myself personally, I still prefer my iPad, but if on a budget, you won\\'t regret the investment. It\\'s so simple I sometimes struggle using it. The free time experience is awesome for little ones and I can set parameters, which is a huge bonus. For a first-time tablet user, this is a solid product. A very good product by amazon. Considering the price, even better. Good for watching movies, reading books and playing games but don\\'t expect to do much more. Everything else can be a challenge and it can get laggy and once in a while it\\'ll just shut down a program or completely reboot. Excellent product. I would definitely purchase again. After using this tablet for a while, I have found that I even prefer this size over my iPad Air. Easy to carry around and long battery life make this my preferred device. The screen is just the perfect size for my older eyes, the screen on the 7\" fire is just too small and cramped, and it seemed a lot less responsive. I highly recommend this sweet tablet. This was a BIRTHDAY GIFT for my LITTLE one and she LOVED it! I purchased two of these as Christmas presents for my children. I had been researching child friendly tablets with robust controls to keep them away from undesirable content. I found the 7\" Fire Kids Edition, but after looking over the specs and reviews, I found myself unsure of it. I was mostly interested in the FreeTime application, so I did some research on that and found that it was available on other Fire models also. I came across the new Fire HD8, which had more power, a better screen, and far better battery life at a very affordable price point. I gave them a shot and I\\'m glad I did.I have the Fire HD8\\'s locked into FreeTime mode, so the only activities that can be done are ones that I approve of, but if I want to, I can pick up either of them and unlock them to access Netflix/Amazon Prime or anything else I desire. I currently have reading goals set up that they must achieve before they are able to access videos or games, and those are limited to X amount of time per day. FreeTime also has a bedtime feature which disables/enables the use of the tablets during designated times, which is amazing.The hardware itself is exceptional. The screen resolution is excellent, it\\'s very responsive, and the battery life is spectacular! They advertise up to 12 hours of battery life, and depending on screen brightness, ours last almost that long regularly. The only con I can think of is that the cameras are sub-par, but that\\'s not what I purchased the tablets for, so it\\'s a non-issue for myself.Some of the reviews I read cited that the internal storage was easily filled with FreeTime content, so I installed 128GB SD cards in them. I also purchased some rugged children\\'s cases for them off of Amazon.This is probably one of the best purchases I have made in a long time. The sound of silent children reading all day is priceless!!! I bought this tablet for my sister to replace her kindle. We love it except for the fact it would not connect to ATT internet. I suspect this was an ATT problem. The internet could not be authenticated. Since we have had problems with ATT for seven years, I am sure it was a problem with them! Once my sis read the instructions, she was good to go! Great tablet for a kid enjoys very much would buy again Overall, very impressed especially when compared to my iPad mini 4. This tablet does it all and makes for an excellent e-reader, while also boasting specifications that rival any iPad. works great for us for video calling, for kids watching videos My wife loved her gift. I made the right purchase. I own two Amazon fire tablets with this one being the same as owned.. My sister in law wanted a tablet and since I owned one just like this one I figured it to be a good buy.. She just loves it, she is able to do her scheduling, read books and watch her news programs.. It\\'s a great Alertanative to an iPad... great price and just as powerful for a lot less cost.. These Kindle Fire tablets simply can\\'t be beat in terms of value and bang for your buck if you have an Amazon Prime account it would be a crime not to have a Fire tablet.Good strong build quality, very nice bright screen with a strong picture and good resolution. They are pretty responsive, have good battery life and can handle the abuse of letting your kids use it as well. We bought this tablet for our son in college and he loves it. This is my first tablet and it\\'s going well so far. I purchased this for reading and streaming. There have been a few hiccups with regards to a streaming video buffering for a long time and sometimes I have trouble with response on commands, but overall, I\\'m happy. It\\'s been a nice device to have for reading online material offline. Replaced my hd fire 7 because broke screed. Very pleased with the large screen. My only dislike is that being a Kindle, my Kindle books cannot be sorted into categories. It\\'s harder to find new books I\\'ve downloaded some time ago when I have to search through all of them. Purchased as a gift. The receiver loves it and said that it works nicely. Purchased this for my 80 year old mother in law to replace her old cracked screen one. Everything was perfect easy to use and set up. She has zero problems using this for online and reading books. Love it I sent one down to my family in Mexico they loved it Bought this as a gift for my mother. She absolutely loves it. Easy to set up and use. and the price was right. I am loving this tablet. My previous tablet was a 1st year Fire. This tablet is great for reading, games,facebook and emails. This is my third Kindle and I have loved them all. I still have my first Kindle and use it. I just wore my Kindle Fire out with 5 + years use. I am very happy with everything my new one can do. No disappointments at all. I got this for my husband for his birthday. He likes the light weight and the speakers and how powerful it is. Got it for my Dad. Easy to use and he loves it. Good stepping stone for future producs One of the best purchases or investments you could make for technology. I bought it for kindle books and was amazed by its overall features. Its Kindle with features of a TAB. I bought this primarily for reading, but, being a tablet it is able to do so much more! I can listen to music, download movies and check email. I love it! Way better than my Nook! Great tablet for price! Fast, works great, great sound volume, great pixelation and screen size I\\'m new to tablets but this one is pretty easy to understand and use.There\\'s a decent amounts of apps at start up, which can be good and bad. i would buy this item again. however charging port is so far. A few not so great things, modt of them managed to resolve them though. This is a nice little tablet and Great for the kids Not a huge fan of products that aren\\'t Apple but this one is good. Haven\\'t had any problems with them at all. I bought this for my sister as a gift so she need not use her laptop for basic internet surfing and to watch movies while travelling. The device speed is decent although you cannot compare the performance to a laptop. If you want to avoid carrying a bulky laptop during travel and want a budget make do device for laptop then choose amazon fire tablet. I got this tablet for my mother and cousins. It\\'s been very speedy to my surprise, not as fast as a high end tablet but no lag and a very nice 720p display with good build quality. Would definitely recommend if your looking for an affordable tablet YOU PAY FOR THE BEST AND YOU GET THE BEST. THANK YOU BEST BUY FOR PROVIDING THIS PRODUCT I have an older Kindle and enjoyed it very much. However, there is so much more improvement in this tablet with faster processing speed, upgradable storage and longer battery life. I\\'m really happy! This was the perfect tablet for what my husband wanted. 8\" size was not too big or too small. You can carry it without it being clumsy to drop. I love my kindle.It is user friendly and there\\'s so much more than I thought. Great little tablet after you add google play store. Takes some research to do. Awesome tablet and great value for money. My son is enjoying it a lot. I bought this as a cheap alternative to an old, slow, iPad 2, until I could spring for the iPad Pro. Got it as a Black Friday deal, so it was more than worth it. Was able to add some missing apps that make it even better than I thought it could be, and having Amazon Prime makes it an inexpensive and handy media device. I carry it in my bag at all times without having to worry about it\\'s value. Can\\'t beat it for the price. I love to read! Books,books, books and more books. Longtime Apple user, but for this price vs an iPad you can\\'t beat this product! Easy to use. Great picture clarity. Wish they had a cellular version. I got this because it was a cheap tablet. It does great for watching videos from the tablet and sound is good also. I don\\'t like the amazon ecosystem or app store. I wish they would sell android tablets with their apps on them like they are doing with their phones. This is a good tablet to own. I like the features. My son needed a tablet to take notes on at college classes. He wanted something small and lightweight instead of taking his laptop. He\\'s found it to work perfectly for what he needs! the first worked fine for three weeks then stopped. took back and got a replacement. this one lasted almost a month. again took it back and was told I had to deal with Amazon.Found out thru Amazon webpage that units simply froze up and how to reset it. Was upset that store associate knew nothing about the product. Had to research everything myself. purchased for my sister for reading books, internet and games - perfect for beginners and novices. Easy to use. Would be a five if available with 4g Love the added space. Easy to move around in. I am excited to use all the new features. Gave as Christmas gift,and wife loved it. She has not put it down since she has gotten it. I love this new Amazon Fire HD. I have a 6 year old and I\\'ve set it up so that he has his own password and he loves to read all the free books available. The different shades of back lights are cool. If you purchase the new Amazon Fire HD, it will enhance your reading experience. I decided to buy this instead of a traditional kindle and I do not regret my decision at all!The only con (for those evaluating this as a tablet) is that Amazon has their own App Store. Many apps from GooglePlay/AppStore are simply not available. We had an old Fire and upgraded to the Fire HD. Love everything about it so far. The fire tablet is a great tool for reading, surfing the web, playing games and even watching some Netflix, on a bigger screen, without killing a cell phone charge. Great value! This tablet is great for everything. It\\'s not as powerful as an iPad but the price can\\'t be beat. I like that it is a good reader and that you can also put some apps on it -- I use it to check email, one note, etc. but primarily as a reader. Got this tablet cause I wanted to start reading more graphic novels and manga and was very impressed with it it runs smooth and even use Hulu and netflix on it. My only flaw with it is that there are ads on your lock screen though you can take them off for $15 other than that it\\'s a grade little tablet! My wife wanted this and I got it for her. She has been totally happy with it. She loves it for its size for reading online books. I am very pleased with my purchase the tablet is a great project is there a product is very versatile Great tablet. Easy to use. Will recommend it to others. If you\\'re looking for a small but effective tablet that\\'s reasonably priced, this tablet is the one for you. It\\'s easy to understand the directions, therefore making it a snap to learn how to work the tablet. It comes in different colors and is easy to read and use. Give it a try. Thanks, Best Buy!!! Very competitive Price - Unit works well we like color and size The HD8 and HD7 are amazing for the price. They aren\\'t top powered tablets, but they\\'re functional tablets. Right now, in Feb 2017, either one is a good replacement for the Nexus 7. Bought this for my niece and she loves it. Very easy to use from what she tells me! I really liked the build quality but the very lackluster performance and minuscule battery life didn\\'t make it a keeper for me. Such a a great tablet that does everything, love it! I am an avid Amazon user for shopping and tablets, I bought a different model for my younger brother and now purchased this one for my grandparents and they love it! I purchased this for my parents who were always viewing facebook or other videos on their cell phones, this Amazon tablet is perfect for them! It\\'s user friendly and if you have an Amazon Prime account has great access to movies and music. I\\'ve had iPad mini\\'s before so this tablet in my opinion can\\'t compare. However, that being said. I bought this tablet for the purpose to watch Netflix and read books on. In my opinion it handles these two task perfectly. The screen isn\\'t as clear and crisp like other tablets but hey I didn\\'t pay $300 for it either. I like this size and it seems fast. I\\'d have to say I like it a lot. On another note, I\\'m giving this review only 4 stars because i am absolutely annoyed at Best Buy and their shipping. This is about the 3rd time I\\'ve ordered a product and had it shipped to me and Best Buy said it would be here at a certain date and UPS screws It up every time. Don\\'t have any issues anywhere else but always when I order from Best Buy and have it mailed to me. Anyways, the tablet is good for the price and I\\'d recommend it over any other lower end teblets. I bought one for my 9 year old son for his birthday - and now we are buying another one for our ten year old. We have had some tech issues as we are juggling three tablets on one account - but with careful monitoring, it\\'s ok. Wonderful little buy! Tired of my bulky tablet. This one stays charged a lot longer! Nice tablet with the slightly bigger screen, great for tv, movies and reading especially for older eyes. Good size as well, it fits nicely into a purse or tote without being too heavy I like because I can download movies to watch offline with netflix I bought this tablet for my mom on her birthday recently. She loves it and uses it all the time. I always wanted a tablet and finally decided on the amazon fire 8. It is awesome and I love it.I downloaded some games and I am enjoying them. It is great for internet too. Definitely worth the price. You get a lot for the money. It had lots more options too. It was okay, but most of my apps were stripped down versions on the HD-Fire. It was inexpeisve, but you get what you pay for. The O/S is pretyy premitive. The hardware does fell nice. I would say it is the perfect device for an older or younger person. ok for price a little slow and doesn\\'t have as many apps as google play. I have owned several kindles. I don\\'t know what I do to them, but they tend to die rather quickly. Thank goodness for Best Buy\\'s extra protection. The last two that quit on me were replaced quickly and effortlessly. Excellent customer service as well! Love using this Kindle to look up real estate sales, play mind games, and take pictures. Love the bigger screen and the great resolution. Sound is also far superior to my older model Lindle. Wife loves it. She said it opens much faster and likes auto updates for apps. Super easy to set up and use :)Got one for daughter and got one for self!!!!!! the tablet is great, but all the advertising is annoying This Tablet does absolutely everything I want! I can watch TV Shows or Movies, check my Mail, Facebook, Google.......pay all my bills. It processes fast and has a beautiful screen. As I said: Everything I want in a Tablet for less than $100! And she has been happy about it ever since. Not being that tech saavy, this specific device has a user-friendly tutorial to help get started. Got this to replace the Samsung tab A 7\". That Samsung tab lagged a lot but I haven\\'t seemed to have as much problems on the fire tab, the only downside is that the battery dies fast. I have had a Samsung Tablet for 3 years, and I have to say that I love this Amazon Kindle 10x better. The picture quality is amazing, it is light weight, it is easy to navigate. Great tablet, great screen, great price! Very user friendly, especially for a not so Tech savvy person. This is as good as my my Ipod! I would recommend it Needed a new tablet for reading books, movies and surfing the Web. This meets all my needs! Great upgrade from Kindle Fire. Reasonably priced for product. I would recommend this to my friends that you can shop on amazon has many preloaded games. Many Apps Great Product and great Price! Love it i would recommend to anyone who is looking for tablet on a good price Simple and easy to use!! The wife takes it everywhere! Easy to use! Just plug in and search for your favorite movies and TV shows. I love my new Fire HD! I had one of the first generation Kindle Fire, and loved it, love this one even more!!! I didn\\'t do any in depth research on this particular tablet. The price and speed were good for what I wanted it for. My only con is not being able to clear the home screen of apps or relocate them so I can see my personal home screen picture. I gave it as a gift to a friend who is a senior citizen who had an Amazon Paperwhite. I thought this would be a lovely upgrade for her and it has been. She loves it!! Great device very functional love it will recommend Bought this for my Father-In-Law for Christmas and he loves it. Easy to use and has already bought 5 books for it! Can\\'t say enough good about it. My 10 year old loves it. Enjoy the Kindle, fun games, can access the Internet, read books, etc. The tablet works just great and the price can\\'t be beat! We did get this when it was in sale for about 50$ and for that this is an incredible value tablet perfect for anyone who wants a screen without paying premium prices. Build quality is fine and screen isn\\'t the best but definitely usable. It\\'s not a regular tablet but I just use it to use Facebook The screen is clear and tablet is faster than i expected. Great colors also! Not the most powerful tablet but is flawless when utilizing the Amazon programs Bought this for my elderly mother who was wanting the ability to read and/or listen to books. After a slow start getting her going (she is not tech savvy) she is really enjoying the versatility of this tablet. Although it does not have cellular data ability, which she had no use for, it gives her the flexibility to connect to wireless networks when she makes her weekly casino visits. For the price it can\\'t be beat. That being said I had to return mine after a week. I just couldn\\'t get over the low resolution screen. It works well for movies and the Web, but I needed it to also show off my photos to others. This was a gift to a friend. So far she loves it.. Books and magazines are easy to access and read!!! Bought this for my 8 year old in place of a Nabi that didn\\'t work out of the package. Great basic tablet for this. As I reviewed different tablets, this tablet kept coming back as my best option for the items I was looking for. It IS a great tablet, but there are a few things I don\\'t really like about it. I didn\\'t realize that Amazon has it\\'s OWN browser SILK. Everything even your banking info goes through Amazon. Not sure I like that. Also, items don\\'t automatically close out when you leave a page and I have to frequently hit the button on the bottom and close out multiple items. It might just be that I am not THAT computer savoy, though I do know how to navigate my way around. Sometimes the touch feature just seems to freeze and won\\'t recognize that I am attempting \\'touch\\'. Lastly, the on/off button is right where you hold the tablet on the side, so I am often \\'accidently\\' shutting it down. Most annoying! Overall, I am happy with my purchase and for the price I like it. Just wanted to point out the other items. serves all my needs in a economy tablet and I would reccomend it to all. Good product with best price available in the market place Tablet is a great tool to use the world wide web and check email. works great, wife loves it. Always happy with the kindle Has a few quirks that are disconcerting bur overall a great product. Only a few quirks when it comes to this Kindle. Better quality sound and display. Great tablet. Picture is super sharp and so easy to read. I picked this tablet up for a 5 year old grandchild as a way to learn how to use a tablet works fine . We previously bought a 7 inch, 8 GB Kindle for my son which he used a lot. Eventually though he dropped it and it no longer worked. This past Christmas we purchased the Amazon Fire HD8, 16 GB.This model was an improvement over the previous one. With twice the internal storage, my son wasn\\'t always coming to me to delete games because he ran out of storage. Another great feature is the external SD card slot. We bought a 32 GB card and he\\'s not had to delete anything.The quad-core processor is a big improvement over the previous gen model. Apps and games load quickly with not lag in running them. There also seemed to be an improvement in the battery life so it doesn\\'t have to be charging all the time or plugged in the the power cord.This is a great purchase for any child! Excellent product.Relable.Maximum speed.Fast downloading Love this tablet. It\\'s big enough so I can see. It works with my prime so I can watch movies or stream music. I purchased a Kindle a few years ago and Have loved the flexibility it give me. I can browse the internet without moving to my desk to get on my personal computer. I love the fact that I can continue to read my books while I travel. Doctor Office Visits seem to just roll by more calmly now because I can ignore the office chatter and the TV selections I rather not watch. I encouraged others to make the purchase and several have done just that. This is my second purchase. Love It! I purchased this for my mother and she has been going on about how wonderful the Amazon fire is. It\\'s the perfect size easy to use and she can even do her banking on it which she loves. I would definitely recommend the Amazon fire thank you This is my second kindle. I love using them for reading, web searching, etc. I download some of my favorite knitting patterns, so when on the road I have something to work with.I love love love this kindle. Bigger screen, slimmer and lighter. Great tablet just what my wife wanted, loves the wifi, much better than her old one. Was a gift and they love the tablet! Its a great price and works awesome! The amazon fire tablet 2016 is quite good. It provides sufficient content & ability to do all of the basics one requires in a tablet. The 8 inch screen is bright and provides various settings. The tablet\\'s light weight makes it very portable. Need to buy a tablet for my Mother as a Christmas gift. Functionality is great and she uses it for all her online needs The Fire HD 8 is the perfect size EReader. Big enough to see the text but small enough to hold comfortably. I bought this Amazon Fire HD8 as a Christmas present for my wife. It is the second tablet I have given to her over the past 5 years. She LOVES it! It goes wherever she goes. The Fire is more than portable and so easy to use. As the saying goes: \"A Happy Wife Means A Happy Life\". I wouldn\\'t hesitate to recommend the Fire to anyone! Gave this to my daughter for Christmas. She loves it. Uses it every day. Good buy! I use it mainly for reading e-books and browsing. However, I wished there were more apps available. Also, before unlocking the tablet, ads are shown in the lockscreen. If the tab is locked, it stops streaming the ads. You can pay $15 to disable the ads permanently. I only recommend this for basic use. If you want to use it for games or other apps, I would recommend a stronger tablet like the ipad or samsung galaxy. This is my second Kindle Fire, and the only reason is because I upgraded. They\\'re a great little tablet. Very versatile and fast loading times. Definitely recommend. Good quality android tablet. also makes a very nice gift. I purchased this for my 12 year old and it was at a great price point. I like the parental controls feature with the multiple profiles. This allows me to control what she has access to which is a plus for me. Thanks perfect for my little kids they love this tablet good quality and fast enough for them Can\\'t say enough about the Kindle Fire. It literally is fiiiiiiyah... fast, easy to use, and an all-around perfect tablet. Recommend keeping an eye out for special pricing at holidays to save some cheddar, but otherwise I\\'d say pick this little black rectangle of portable interwebz awesomeness up the first chance you get. The best product for the money. East to use, great color, great features. easy to set up and battery life is great. This was a gift for a family member they really enjoy all the options of getting books I bought this one for 40$ during the black Friday sale, as a gift to my cousin. He was flattered by the performance, even I didn\\'t expect it to be this good! It works flawlessly with the usual games and apps, what you are going to miss the most is YouTube, amazon\\'s app store does not have youtube. Other than that it meets all my requirements for daily use. Best B It is helping them to learn to read and follow directions .Best Buy had the products and provided great customer service. Grandsons are enjoying product use. This tablet exceeds its reviews. its easy to use and the screen is great. My husband and I purchased the new Amazon Kindle Fire HD 8 tablets for our 16 yr old son and 12 yr old daughter for Christmas. I have an older version 7 in myself so I already knew we were buying a durable tablet. The new ones are awesome and they had them in colors so very easy to distinguish who\\'s is whom We purchased during Black Friday and got them for $30 off, which was an amazing discount and made me love it even more. We had shopped around many places prior to and. They are light weight and the screen is plenty big enough for them to watch movies, play games, do homework and video calls friends and family out of town. They seem to have plenty of space and nice to know that we can add memory if we need to.The tablets hold up to the everyday life of the kids accidental drops kicks and their 3 yr old sister lol. Would definitely recommend this product to anyone who is in the market for a new tablet for themselves or children. Will buy again in the future if these ever quick working. Bought it for my little grandson he likes games, he can play with it where ever there is wifi. the tablet was on sale for a good price, and they had enough in stock for the CHRISTMAS season> grand children were thrilled. Good tablet and a great price. I use it for reading, Netflix and email. good for beginners play games ,take picture and recording videos old the time Won the kindle fire 6 last xmas2015 at work raffle. Gladly got this kindle fire 8 for a bigger screen and better battery life. Love it. One of the best inexpensive tablets on the market. Great for the casual user Loving this tablet, 5 stars in my opinion, definitely worth it. Easy and fun to use. Also, a perfect size even for a man\\'s hand. Bought as a gift and they love it! Great for the price. I went in to buy my 88 year old Dad an Amazon Fire book reader....The customer service from the begining was great!. An Associate immediately approached me, showed me several models, with explaining them all. After picking one. I was then told of the \"free shipping\" of which i did utilize. My dad received within a couple of days , on his birthday, and was able to go to his local Best Buy, and have an Assocate show/explain how to use. He was sooo excited and pleased with the item and service....and so am I. Also, the price was right tooo! This is a great reading product. Love the light adjustment in low light areas. I can adjust the font sizes for my reading comfort and I can do other things like download apps or watch movies! i really loved my 7in. but i love 8.5 in. a whole lot.!!!!!!!!!!!!!thanks guys!!! I bought this 8\" Amazon Fire HD for my Wife as a Christmas Present. Her old 7\" Amazon Fire that she had for about 3-4 Years. She is very happy with the 8\" Amazon Fire HD. Can\\'t beat the price for a Tablet. My son loves it, he can watch videos, read books and play games. Excellent and inexpensive. ITunes store and Google Play store have more apps to choose from, but this is still a very useful tablet. Expandable SD micro memory a definite +. Have not had time to REALLY use it, but hope to download books and games. This is a great, easy to use tablet for the price. It\\'s a 16 GB mini-computer and camera perfect for trips. enjoying reading via the device; lots of options is also a plus; a little heavy to hold when reclining Needed a present for mom, at first she didn\\'t use it much cause she had to set it up but now it\\'s great and she loves it. Bought this for my 83-year old Mother. She loves it! We bought it two days before it went on sale for Christmas and Best Buy was excellent with price matching asesome!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! performs as designed got it on sale for 79 dollars Is great for my son 8 years old, they help with homework We own an ipad,samsug tablets and we have both love are fire8\\'s wave better. This tablet was affordable and it\\'s pretty decent. Bought this for my dad, he is 87. Very easy to use and setup. He loves it and uses it 3/4 hours a day At first was going to get a iPad but I decided to get this instead way cheaper then a iPad and just as good, love it.. Couldn\\'t recommend this more for kids. Price and features are awesome along with parental controls. The functionality is great although I wish it came in more colors. I didn\\'t actually use as I bought for a gift. My grandson already had one so we returned for a pair if 3-d goggles. use as a reader and music, games watches movies i good all round tablet Just thought we were purchasing a capability to download and read books, magazines, etc. But, for such a low price was surprised at the total capabilities available. I GOT THE FIRE HD SO MY KIDS COULD READ BOOKS , PLAY GAMES AND WATCH THEIR SHOWS . WITHOUT SPENDING AN ARM AND A LEG FOR THE TABLET. I THINK THIS IS A GOOD TABLE FOR KIDS / YOUNG TEENS WHO WANT TO HAVE A TABLET BUT NOT BREAK THE BANK. We bought one for my wife and my mother-in-law and they both love it. Very easy to use. My kids love it. Battery life is longer than others. This was a gift for my mother who is 99 years. She used to love puzzles, but with arthritis and failing eyesight she couldn\\'t do them. The puzzle app is good because she can see it and use finger to slide pieces. She can keep up with family on Facebook Very decent tablet. I was skeptical at first but it\\'s performance surprised me. Battery lasts a decent amount of time and connects beautifully into the Amazon ecosystem I already am in. Would recommend to anyone who likes to watch videos/browse the web on the go or for children. I purchased this for traveling. I can access my e-mail, books and games without lugging my laptop. I\\'m sure I will learn more as needed. Best buy was very helpful & the tablet is good for reading books & basic serfing This is a perfect size and weight. Everything is very clear, sharp and large enough to be comfortably readable. Word has it that relationships are interrupted by electronic devices. Well my girl takes her reader everywhere we go. She used to tell me I talk to much. Now I can hardly get a word in edgewise! This is smaller and lighter than my previous fire and works even better It\\'s not a $400.00 tablet so what can you expect, except that it does what it\\'s suppose to. It\\'s faster than I thought it would be so thats killer. So far I love this tablet especially for reading. The battery life has also been good Everything I expected with none of the drawbacks I have found in other tablets Works well. Probably best android tablet you can get for the money. Great tablet. No problems at all. Excellent Price. the only downside of it is that you can\\'t have google playstore on this tablet but you can still install it manually since they both based on android os I bought it for my mom after moving her into an assisted living place. . I was able to use it a little to show mom I was very happy with it. Seems fast and easy to use.i like it better than my phone . :) Didn\\'t get a chance to see how camera was yet. I love everything about my new kindle except for the fact that the charging cord is already loose. Great for those who love to read this tablet is always ready for on the go trips Bought the fire for my mother who is 72 to learn how to use a computer the price was right and she can use it to search the web I only have an older ipad to compare this to, but there is literally no comparison. The Fire 8\" tablet is lightweight, connects ultra fast to wifi, has an easy-to-follow automatic set up, and comes with tons of features that I\\'m only beginning to explore. I wasn\\'t expecting this at all! I\\'m a total convert especially because the price is so reasonable, too. This is a great Tablet. Love the features and resolution Super fast. Lots of storage. Great tablet for anyone. bought as a gift for Christmas. they love it!!!!!! This is an upgrade tablet from my first Kindle Fire that I purchased 5 years ago. Love the larger screen the quick processing and downloads, the great HD visuals, and most importantly all of my previous pictures and music files were easily transferred/accessed by this new device. Love that this Fire has a front and rear camer too, my old Fire only had a front facing camera. Granted this is not an iPad, but I don\\'t want or need all an iPad does. And I definitely don\\'t want to spend hundreds of dollars on a device just because it is cool. My Fire tablet does everything I need or want and it costed under $99.00. I am one satisfied and pleased customer. very easy to use I live my fire the best purchase I have made in months The only reason why I have not given a 5 star review is because sometimes, the unit freezes out of nowhere after I will be reading news articles or after watching Prime/Netflix Gift for Mom. This is her first tablet. She is having no issues so far. Great value for the price. Easy to navigate and has good picture quality. I bought it to watch Netflix, browse internet, read books on Kindle, and watch YouTube. Very nice tablet for low price. The shell feels a little on the cheap side but added a cover (Fintie) & feels much more sturdy. Great for reading or watching netflix or amazon video. Purchased this to get a lighter tablet. Also to update our my old tablet which had a replaceable battery. This is all around lighter ,thinner and easier to handle. HD is a good upgrade and can\\'t beat the price for comparable tablets with same features. my wife reads on it daily and loves it. I am probably going to search for another one.We have the 8\" and I would like to try a 7\" if it were available.I like to try different size devices to see how I adjust same way with todays phones. I\\'d recommend this highlyGreat buy for the priceGood graphics and easy to use. Good product bought it as a Christmas gift. I will be purchasing another one soon. Wanted one that played bejeweled blitz. This one does not. A gift to my 3 year old grandson. Great graphics and sound. The size of the Fire tablet gives you the feel of having a book in your hands while reading a book. Because of the size and lightweight it\\'s easy to transport and fits easily in my purse. I\\'m enjoying my Fire tablet which was a gift. The tablet is Excellent! Very fast and well worth the money! The display is great! I got this for my kid as a gift so he could read books easier and it has helped a ton! I got an 8\" windows tablet for my father in law and we quickly realized that windows is not a good choice for someone that is not already comfortable with all the windows features that are not tablet friendly. This tablet on the other hand, had a very easy learning curve and my father in law became comfortable with all the features in a couple of hours. I would definitely recommend it as a gift. The 8 inch Amazon Fire 6th edition is by the far the best tablet in the Amazon market. The 7-inch is a nice size, but the 8-inch has better screen resolution and longer battery life. If you are an Amazon Prime member, this is a must have tablet. Also, the Amazon magnetic case does a great job in protection and sleek-ness. I bought four of these for my kids and they love them Great tablet for my childthis tablet was just everything that I need it for my child Very easy to use and small enough to travel with. I slide it right into my bag. I would recommend this ereader above all others for its high quality and diversity. Not only as an ereader but as a web browser. I got my father a Amazon Fire he\\'s never used a tablet let alone a computer. So it was a challenge. He did pretty good but ha\\'s a hard time seeing the screen. I love my new Kindle Fire even more than my old one which I lost. Very good buy. I am enjoying my new tablet. Great buy! Learning all the aps that are on the Kindle, the games and all the free books. Perfect for a kid and it was cheap! My son has broke a lot of tablets, this one seems durable. I travel a lot and this is perfect for watching movies or reading on the flights The Kindle is great! It\\'s easy to set up and I\\'ve found all the books that I wanted. I got this on an impulse buy, mostly for my 16+ hour flight, but also just in general. Was in line buying something when I saw this at an unbelievable price! So I bought it and have no regrets! For the price ($69.99) it\\'s a great tablet, though you can only get apps through the amazon app store not the Android app store, which limits you. But that\\'s alright, as I mostly got it for watching videos and movies and that sort of stuff. And occasionally some games! Great tab and the price cannot be beat, Only gripe is the fire os. Oh well This tablet is great for the price. It has good connection to wi if. The kindle store is a breeze. The picture quality is good. And seems to be the perfect size. A nice alternative compared to The more expensive tablet. And much better quality then the less expensive tablets I would recommend I bought two Kindle Fires for my 4 year old twin grandsons this past Christmas. We downloaded lots of educational programs for them and they absolutely love it! No need to buy them an IPAD which was far more costly! I have had every version of the Kindle since the week it was introduced and jumped at the chance for a Kindle Fire. I replaced the first one I had in 2014 and it was everything I wanted except this past summer it started overheating and got nonresponsive in the midday heat. So...I got this one. First of all I miss Swype. WHY get rid of it? Secondly I cannot put two of my favorite apps (which work on my old one) to work on this but lastly and most importantly: every once in awhile the screen freezes with a bunch of code \"shimmering\" in the background and only turning it off and/or leaving it for awhile brings it back to life AND it turns itself off. It seems to happen when I close a program and move to a new one. Aggravating and not what I expect from a product with which I have been happy in the past. My granddaughter love this fire for al her games. We also downloaded a music app for her and she is so happy with this. So many things she will learn how to do on this tablet. Bought a Kindle Fire for my wife several years ago, our son is now 9 and he had kind of taken over the tablet from my wife. So we decided he was responsible enough and bought this for him for Christmas. I cannot believe the improvement over the previous Kindle Fire we own. The screen is more clear and bright and even seems more detailed, apps load faster, it connects to the internet faster. For the $89.99 they currently sell for I would say it is an excellent value. If you can wait, we paid less at Christmas so a lower price could be seen again. We\\'ve had three of these Kindles. They are well built and you can\\'t get the quality in a tablet from any other manufacturer. Amazon has great support with them. This was a great purchase! Love the fact I can download TV or movies and watch off-line. Easy set up. I bought this for my wife she loves how easy it is to use and small enough to take on trips. I bought the first edition kindle fire years ago. My kids loved it so much that I bought this product to replace the old one. They love this one even more. Larger screen and more memory, you can\\'t go wrong! Gift for my grandpa so he can do internet searches from his chair and play games. He loved it. It\\'s simple to use and inexpensive I love my kindle fire it\\'s is good for watching movies reading and anything you need a tablet for. We get this after my son broke his Samsung tablet and I told was android operating system but wen the time to set it up came, takes me a little lounger to make a new account, password and paretal control for my kid but am happy that finally did it This was a replacement for an Amazon Fire tablet. This was a an up grade for my daughter who broke the screen on her old one. She absolutely loved her old one. She says the new one is even better.!! I bought this kindle fire for my teenage son so he could use it at school and play games on the kindle, he loves it. You will not find another tablet like this with the affordable price. This tablet is small enough to pack but the screen is the perfect size for watching movies on the plane when traveling. love the ease of use with tablet, have not had any issues I highly recommend kindles. I wouldn\\'t own anything else. I love reading and this is the best device yet not only for reading. This has wifi capabilities. I would highly recommend this item. I had Microsoft Surface, unfortunately daughter dropped and cracked screen so needed a new tablet. Since went back to laptop for work didn\\'t need another Surface. Settled on 8\" Kindle HD over Samsung and IPad mini due to value. I only use for social networks, email, games, internet search, and occasional viewing of videos. This is a good basic tablet that can handle this no problem with a good wifi connection. Great value as I paid under $100 during the holidays and it has been as good as my Surface for these basic uses. I recently upgraded to this model of Kindle. Liked it so much I bought this one for my daughter. She loves it. It\\'s much nicer than the older model she and I had. I had a very early generation Kindle that I loved. I was unwilling to update my Kindle because it was so great. The new one I got from my wife made it look like the old one was standing still. It\\'s much faster and I love it. I love this tablet because of its user friendly interface. It reminds me of a starter tablet for kids, without being too much of a dull product. Great product. I got this as a gift for a family member and she loves it. Wry basic, but I guess, it\\'s ok for the price. Bought for a 6 year old. Bought as gift for senior. Setup process could be easier. Nice handheld size. Clear text. Easy to read books on. Bought this for my daughter to use in school, she loves it! Product works great! I also bought the older version for my mom and she lives it as well I would like to say this is my best tablet I have ever buy till now. I will rate it more then iPad Mini. Its best with battery, wifi, touchscreen, sound etc. I had other tablet for my kids earlier, but after having fire hd8, I will not recommend or like to go for any other brand in future. You can\\'t get such good quality product in such less price. I am really very happy on my right decision to choose fire hd8 for my family and kids. This is a good product for your money. It\\'s basic it does the job. Love the access to films. Easy to read and work with. A Little like an Android. I am used to IPhone apps but this works great once you understand it. Broke the screen on our 2nd gen fire so this is it\\'s replacement. Easy setup, Much faster than older one. Just the right size for games, email, social media. This is decent reader and Netflix device. Lots of bugs and gotchas when trying to use - icons going off screen, random locking, random performance hits while doing the same task. Returned. Buying an iPad mini 2. The build quality is just not there. Great and informative service. The guy who helped us was very friendly. Love the Fire, the picture is good and really like the amazon link I have an LG tablet but picked up this one for my Dad and after messing with it for a while it\\'s very nice,. I think I like it more the my LG g pad! This is a great tablet. My family and I love it. Lots of feature and faster than I thought it would be. Better then the older models bigger and better then before I really enjoy my amazon. It is getting easyer to use and I am finding new apps every day. This tablet is awesome...HD resolution, fast processor and affordable! Highly Recommended. Nice tablet. Very speedy. The only thing I don\\'t like is that I can\\'t add GooglePlay apps to it. At only $69.00 I guess that\\'s to be expected. I use my kindle on a daily basis. It is a good size for reading in bed. The kindle was great but too small for my vision impaired mother, it was a gift, My son totally loves it! The size is just right, and it is pretty fast. I don\\'t have any complaints about it. On Christmas Eve I went in looking for an iPad as a gift. They were sold out and I was directed to the Amazon Fire HD8. The picture quality is amazing (hence the HD). I watched a movie on it and the picture was better than my HD tv. I have to say, I would buy this tablet over an iPad any day...AND it cost less than a fourth of the price! Decent tablet for the price. My kids love them!!!! I am extremely pleased. Fast. Efficient. Reliable. Purchased to watch movies. Quality is great. Sound from tablet needs work but earphone is usually used or at least recommended for personal use. My son loves his kindle fire. He uses it every day. The Amazon Fire HD8 tablet is a high quality, inexpensive piece of technology that works great for anyone looking to purchase one that won\\'t break the bank. Once taking time to install google play store, It functioned as good as any other android tablet. The down side is camera which doesn\\'t produce clear pictures. Bought for someone not tech savvy and he\\'s done great Bought this tablet on sale. I can look up all the things I \\'m interested in. This is a great product second one i purchase recomend it. The tablet has a very clear and crisp screen. The device is easy to setup. There is a quite abit of preinstalled apps. The responsiveness is great, connectivity is good, but sound is not great. This tablet is great considering how affordable it is! I mainly use it for reading, streaming shows, and listening to music. I do wish it was a true Android platform instead of the \"Amazon Android\" platform, but overall it\\'s a great little tablet! It\\'s great for my 7 year old. Easy for her to use. Wasn\\'t happy with first one I opened as Christmas gift, it didn\\'t work from right out of the box. Contacted Amazon and they sent a new one the next day. This one has worked from the get go. I\\'m now enjoying my new tablet. Very happy with Amazons service and prompt response to the issue. This is good for kids. Cheap enough that if they destroy it, you won\\'t get upset Great product for my 10 year old son. Very easy for him to find what he wants Love Alexa and all of its features. Love that I can listen to music and read ebooks Paid $60 for it on sale during holidays, couldn\\'t ask for better product for the price Bought this for each of my grandchildren and they loved it. Very user friendly Great value from Best Buy. Bought at Christmas sale. great tablet well worth the price which was a deal on black friday Original Kindle Fire would finally no longer charge so bought this to replace. Not quite the quality of original (not as fast, resolution not as good) but can\\'t complain for the price. Good choice for casual web surfing and reading. Does the trick. This is a good tablet for the price. I bought this for my 3yr old son and it\\'s perfect for him! With a mixture of games (kid friendly) and read-along books makes it a perfect for the kids and of course there\\'s so much more for adults as well.. great buy! Great tablet, especially for the price. I bought this to replace an old Fire 7 tablet, that I had the battery going down. It works nicely and I love the Kindle Freetime and the parental control settings. Great little tablet for cruzing the internet and using Amazon products. I purchased it hoping I could use it as an inexpensive screen for my DJI Phantom 4. It works OK in this fashion, but I believe it is underpowered for the job. I bought this for my niece and she really enjoyed it. She was able to watch Netflix on it and play games. She could surf the internet if she needed to. We went with the bigger GB since it wasn\\'t much more. Gave it as a door prize at office party. They love it. This tablet is simple to set up and it\\'s worth the price. It\\'s perfect for beginners. Great tablet for easy operation. Was a great upgrade for a family member. My 2nd Fire. Great picture quality. Easy to use. Would recommend for all ages. I bought this to take on cruise to read and listen to music... less expensive than my tablet, so if I loose it not as big a loss... it does all I thought it would..easy to set up... to get the most from this tablet you should be an amazon prime member $100 a year, not required,but lots of benefits from it OK its not an iPad, but it is a very good tablet for less than 100 dollars.My only complaint is that it don\\'t have a true GPS chip and relies on your WiFi reported location for apps and therefore some apps cannot be loaded on this device that rely on a true GPS. But it is a great travel tablet and with an SD card you can download your Amazon or other content and watch offline. A great travel tablet! For the price you get alot of valueGreat for watching movies amazon shopping youtube I got a magenta color because I loved the beautiful purple-ish color shown on the picture. Instead I got a really bright pink-ish color which looks nothing like the color shown here. I went to the store hoping to replace it with a different color but was told that since I bought it on sale, I had to pay the $30 dollar price difference if I wanted to exchange. Unbelievable. The product is good but I never liked the Best buy customer service. This product met all of our my needs and I would recommend it to others. Would recommend for the right person that wants low cost tablet BUT...Ended up returning this item because it was heavy and too wide for my hand to hold. It was too big to hold in hand and too small to use like a larger tablet. Ended up just using my Lenovo Yoga 900 since it was more flexible and only about .5 lb heavier. I have the HD 7 and an HDX 7, and the 8 outperforms them both. If you are an Amazon fan of the eco system, this is a must. The screen is bright and crisp. The processor performs very well with the latest software update. I love it. Bought to use for recent travel. Was able to download several movies and TV shows from Netflix. Seems to have decent storage. Video playback was fine. Just purchased the Amazon Fire 16GB model and so far it has performed as expected. Only drawback is the screen which is somewhat reflective of any light source and needs constant cleaning for smudges from normal use. Easy to set up and use. Nice graphics and lots of apps to choose. I got this for my husband who is technology challenged and so far, he\\'s using it without getting frustrated, which is huge! love the first now a new one. everything at your fingertips. purchased for a little guy, and i am very pleased with it!! Perfect gift for the office co-workers or close friends This is actually a pretty good little tablet. It is not the most powerful and it doesn\\'t have the highest resolution screen. But for the price, you can\\'t go wrong. It does what it is supposed to do and for the low price you won\\'t feel much pain if you break it. A perfect first tablet for the kids or a nice secondary tablet that you can just toss in a bag or the car for road trips. Amazon Fire tablets are the best products in their price ranges, especially if they are on sale as they were at the last Black Friday event. Excellent purchase. I bought this as a way to easily read while on the go. I\\'m disappointed as it\\'s really too big too easily carry around. I\\'ve discovered it\\'s not all that easy to use it for reading purposes This tablet is the best one we\\'ve ever bought. And, the least expensive! It satisfies all of our needs; email, Facebook, Candy Crush, YouTube, Bluetooth broadcasting to a remote speaker. We love it. No frustration whey using the keyboard or finger clicking on icons or commands! i was surprised buy how light and compact this was but still strong enough to do what i needed. Great for reading. Ordering books and use as a tablet. For the price, this tablet is not bad. I found a couple of things that is a bit annoying. Every time you turn on the device, ads will appear in the lock screen. Also the picture gallery, it takes several minutes to load. The wait is very annoying. For the price, you can\\'t beat this tablet. It is fast and basic. I had problems with my White page and was in the process of buying ad new Kindle I found this was a better unit for my use than tine White-page. Perfect for the price. It is great to bring with you on the go. And like I said can\\'t beat the price. The only con is it has a plastic back so be careful. The battery is great. I would absolutely recommend this product. This tablet is not a high-tech state-of-the-art Speed Demon, but on the other hand it is more than good enough for daily use. The two biggest benefits to me are that it now comes with Alexa built in, and, you can download Amazon movies to the device to watch offline, for example on an airplane. These two features alone make it worth the very reasonable price. good value for the money .............................................................................................................. Gave this to my wife for Christmas. Upgraded from the original Kindle. She thoroughly enjoys it. Fire is a good tablet. Portable size . Have bought a couple for gifts as well This tablet is really easy to use and since I\\'m a Amazon Prime member the video\\'s and music is easy to access. I\\'m really surprised how fast the unit compared to my older i-pad. I would recommend this if anyone wants a good value product. This is a great tablet for the money. Perfect for someone who does not want to shell out hundreds for an iPad. like a tablet. great, fast connection. everything I wanted in an electronic reader. No problems with the fire. Works well. Just need a case for it now. Size is very convenient. I bought this for my mom and she loves it. She said it is really easy to use and loves the lighting, it\\'s easy for her to read. Very helpful and friendly. Didn\\'t have too much selection on what I was looking for. But found what I needed. This tablet is so great for the price, but Amazon has always put out excellent product. This is fairly lightweight and pretty fast too. Like all Amazon product it ties all your Amazon accounts so downloads and purchases are super easy. I have dropped it a couple of times and no damage... so it\\'s pretty tough too. It is a great and affordable tablet for my 12 & 13 year old grandsons. It keeps up with the higher speed internet. So far the tablet works great. I got this for my daughter for Christmas and she downloads games no problem. The 16gb is great I\\'m glad I purchased the larger storage capacity. very good for kids to use, play games and watch kids videos. I like that it gets 12 hours of charge time. Easy to use. i bought this on a whim because my brother recommended i try it sometimes. hard to believe how important this is in my life. this has opened up my long forgotten youth with music and videos anytime Was looking for a cheap tablet for my a son to use saw this unit on sale on black Friday good unit. Basic internet plus a ton of Amazon apps and some standard ones too. If you want to use Amazon it is an excellent tool. Easy setup. Confusing screens but practical and inexpensive. Really enjoy this product. Love watching movies and playing games on my Fire HD 8 Great rablet, clear screen and small design. Great for watching movies. Great for keeping around the house and doing basic Internet functions. For traveling it lets you bring books, movies and/or tv shows via Amazon so being Amazon Prime is a plus.For you business travelers, out of the box it can open, view, & edit MS Office files, .docx, .xlsx, & .pptx.All this for 25% the price of a iPad. Yes, the iPad can do more, but do you need it? I pulled the trigger on the fire tablet knowing the I would have to install the google play store separately. with some work this could be the most bang for your buck for an android tablet. Purchased for my niece for a Christmas gift. She loves it no complaints Best tablet money can buy for under 100$. Very happy with its performance and responsiveness. External speaker is much better on this than my more expensive samsung tab E tablet. I use it at home instead of a computer. I gave it four stars instead of five because it seems to lose wifi frequently. However this could be due to house wifi issues. The tablet is fast and easy to use. Love the ease of downloading books. Got this tablet on sale for $59.99 at Best Buy and got Webroot Internet Security free with purchase. This is not a high end tablet but it works really great for many of the things I do. For the price it can\\'t be beat! Easy to use and portable. Took on vacation and it was great to kkep up on emails and news. Really handy. Can check email, read a book. Also can access info on the web. Lightweight. I was hesitant to buy a Fire tablet but I just needed an extra around the house tablet and I was very impressed. If you need a tablet just to browse the internet, watch movies and light basic searches its perfect. Purchased the device for my son to take full benefits of his prime account. A decent device with reasonable features for the low cost. Bought this for my 5 year old son. He navigates through apps and sites easily. The built in Wifi is helpful for car rides. Parental controls blocks him from buying every download he finds attractive. We\\'re still trying to figure out how to get Alexa to audio respond. This product is very easy to set up and use. Has lots of great features that make it fun and easy for kids to play games and read books. Bought this as a Christmas gift for my wife. She is an avid reader. She previously had a B&N Nook which stopped working. This is much nicer and she loves it. Would recommend for someone who likes to read while traveling or simply at home. Bought this tablet for a child at Christmas. After days of research, this tablet seemed to be the best buy of the lot. It had a good processor, decent memory, and good reviews. It should be exactly what a 12 year old would need in a tablet at a great price. I was looking for and cost effective solution to satisfy my childrens desires to have there own SmartPhone to play Games.I like the Parental controls, to limit certain actions and downloads. Great easy tablet for a reasonable price. Not the most super powerful. It can get the job done for simple tasks such as surfing the web, checking email, playing YouTube, etc. screen is clear and responsive. Great inexpensive tablet It was a gift for my granddaughter and she seems very happy with it so far. Purchase for a 12 year old. Sturdy, easy to usr. Great price I gave this as a gift for Christmas and still can\\'t get it set up will have to go to geek squad to help This tablet is great and easy to use. Great way to keep the kids entertain. It replaces my 6\" Fire Kindle. Love the HD quality. Owned a kindle fire HDX for GameCircle years. Finally decided Goodreads upgrade. This fire HD 8 is great. Really Prime the larger screen and new features. Amazon tablet that links to my amazon prime account so that i can watch all my movies and listen to my music. Grandson used a borrowed one at school. So now has his own . Great tablet for children and for entertainment... This is a great tablet for the price it is offered at. Great for amazon prime members. my third amazon fire, has more features than my old one. battery lastlonger Pretty good tablet especially for the price. That being said, it could be slightly faster when opening apps and running certain processes. Overall good machine for the price. Nice size. Good processor speed. Not happy that I cannot gety Google music. I think that my Amazon tablet does all that I need for it to do.Handy to have when traveling.Easy to operate. While this tablet doesn\\'t have the screen resolution that I\\'m used to it\\'s a nice beginner tablet. Faster than my old Fire HD tablet I purchased years ago... Great value. Daughter loves it. Easy to use and navigate for her. I bought the 8\" version on impulse because of an excellent offer on Black Friday. As an Amazon product, it offers Amazon apps. While you can get Google Play apps, it requires some hoops. I just discovered I can\\'t save movies from Netflix because that only applies to the HDX version. So this product has limits. But used as a Kindle reader, or to get email via wifi, or other uses (wifi only) while traveling where you wouldn\\'t want to take an expensive device, it is a good choice. This is such a wonderful value for the money!!Clear display with great color!! Tablet is wonderful for young kids. There\\'s ways to switch it to kid friendly This was a Christmas present so it hasn\\'t had a lot of use yet but so far this tablet has worked well and was straightforward to set up We bought one of these for our 2 year old a few months ago and we liked it so much we bought one as a Christmas present for a 65 year old parent. It obviously isn\\'t the highest quality tablet on the market, but it very responsive and gets the job done. And, you can\\'t beat the price; just a great value. I have two other versions of Kindle tablets and each one gets better. Great screen display allowing for clear and enjoyable viewing. Easy to use. Quick downloading and updating. Perfect size. Works great. Just as advertised. Has a long battery life. Easy tablet to use. Great camera.Touch screen. Very clear screen. I still have my own Kindle since a few years ago and it still works. I love it and my grandkids both love their kindles. this is my 2nd hd 8, very fast and easy, great value Was looking for tablet to read books and this is perfect for that. Turns out the Fire is much better than I expected. Well worth the $50 I paid for it! Gave this as a gift and she was very pleased. Great product at a great price! I am bring it back for an exchange. (a different make) Beautiful picture. Enjoying different apps and looking forward to hours of fun. Works well. Easy to use. I like the auto on when you open the case I bought this for my son for Christmas. He loves it. He can use it to access the web. This item is great for kids, it is education. You canaccess over 13,000 books on amazon. It has helped my son with his reading. I brought this tablet during the Black Friday sale fast forward to Christmas when my 6 year opens it he was happy I set it up for him two days later it crashed never came back on. Blank screen. He was disappointed and so was I . Mom loves the tablet. Easy for her to use, she uses it for Facebook, reading, and some of her games. This was a gift from my wife. I wanted a lighter Kindle and this is it. I have been happy with this new version. Great quality, great price and best of all has good sound. This tablet is great, and it has a good battery life. I\\'d recommend for people who love to read. good value for the money, love the kindle for reading Truly enjoying this fire. My last kindle fire is only 3 years old and works great but want a front and rear camera. Camera takes good pictures. Also like feature of \"Alexia\". got this for wife for christmas she loves thing she can read her kindle book and surf the web like a regular tablet Great e-reader. Easy to download books. Screen is easy to read from. purchased for my mom and showed her a few apps and she took to it without further direction Nice tablet for the price. Being amazon prime member, I am using many amazon services and devices, tablet is really handy for managing it all very easily apart from other basic functinality of tablets. Had a Fire 7 previously which was ok but this one is brighter, faster and the larger keyboard makes a huge difference. Bought this tablet for my mom who struggles with technology. The Fire HD8 was easy to setup and has many great features. She is catching on well and learning new applications daily. A great value. I\\'ve never had a tablet, I-phone, Smartphone . . . Nothing but PCs. This is my first foray into these modern electronics. I must say that, while I still find it very nerve-wracking, this Amazon Fire Tablet has been pretty user-friendly for an old man like me. I\\'m learning something new about it every day. Got it for my grandma. She loves it , has no complaints about it. For the price you can\\'t beat this tablet for kids. I\\'m not a fan of Amazon\\'s super restricted App Store, but the device itself is very good. I love the curfew feature. You can set up times that a child can or can\\'t access the tablet without your permission. This is so much easier to travel with than the lap top. Gave to my Grandchildren for Christmas, would like to get another for the same price for another Grandchild. I took a couple of pictures with the camera and when I went to view them I can\\'t seem to find the pictures. When I bought my tablet they transferred what I had on my 7in but some of the apps didn\\'t transfer. I\\'ll have to come in and have it explained.Other than that I am very pleased with it. Bought this for my gf since she is on her phone playing games etc. I\\'ve used it a few times and like it. Got this for my 11 yr old and my main concern was parental controls. Parental controls are an awesome feature and were easy to set up. Amazon had plenty of free apps for kids that i didnt need to purchase extra. Thank you I\\'m very happy with this purchase! We purchased these because we really liked the price. We also bought protective cases for both and an antivirus program for them. Bought this for my mom for Christmas. It is her first tablet. She loved it, and will have no problems learning to use it. Very straightforward and easy to pick up. Great storage, fantastic resolution and really good features. i really like this tablet..easy to use and looks great. Great tablet for the price, I would definitely recommend the higher gigabyte as it downloads quickly and doesn\\'t take time to upload. It has great picture quality, all the applications seem to load very fast. The device is a good item and I really recommend to everyone This Kindle was purchased on the black friday sale. At the time I felt it was a steal at that price. The first tablet I purchased a few years ago was the original Kindle Fire, the following year I purchased an iPad mini and now have the iPad mini 4. As you may already know, the iPad does not have explandable memory. This Kindle can have expanded memory to 200GB so that was a good selling point for me. After setting this new Kindle Fire up, I noticed that viewing photos were not as clear as the original iPad mini even without retina display, and the color had a greenish-yellowish tint to it. Some may not notice this if they do not have something else to compare it to. I\\'m a pro photographer so this was quite unaceptable to me. I was not expecting perfection with the colors but people\\'s skin tones appeared greenish as if they were Vulcans. I also like to read tech manuals and magazines of which many are in PDF format. The Kindle will read this format but the Kindle Fire after all these years still cannot display the cover art from pdf books, etc.; it displays an acrobat pdf document logo instead. If you have a large library of pdfs you have to read through the document titles instead of being able to select by seeing the cover of the book. That was enough for me, I\\'ve been spoiled by the ease of use of the iPad and the display with accurate colors. Back to the store for a prompt refund it went. Overall..still a good deal but if you are used to an iPad for the reasons I am..you may be disappointed. Works well. But does not offer access to the apple or android App Store. Without the apps that I need, this tablet is not as useful. this Amazon fire tab works really well.the syncing aspect is very nice being able to pair it with all my devices.i wish it had Google play. It\\'s a really good gadget ...I love everything about it... I would definitely recommend it to others since it is a good value for money product. Nice easy-to-use tablet. We just got it and so far so good Easy to use and please send me a $50 gift certificate for filling out this survey or cash works too. I bought this for my son. He been reading books and searching stuff on line and watching youtube on it. He said it didn\\'t hurt his eyes like the iPad. great product I would recommend this tablet, grest price This tablet is by far one of the best purchases we\\'ve made for my son. The kids feature is extra nice! While the Fire hd8 tablet certainly will not perform like some of the more expensive units, for basic web surfing, email, and especially shopping on Amazons web site, this tablet performs well, although it will occasionally freeze while surfing some sites. The screen resolution is what I would call \\'adequate\\', but not on par with other high resolution (and far more expensive) tablets out there.Overall, I am pleased with this tablet-so far. Purchased this Kindle Fire HD8 from Best Buy. My fiancé downloaded her first book. She already started reading and said it is really cool to use. She said it is easy to see and navigate. I have enjoyed using the Fire HD. It is fast and easy to use. I also appreciate all the things it will do. The kindle fire hd is a sweet tablet for reading and apps like netflix or hulu. It does everything my kids need without having to pay a ridiculous price. The kindle is great not only is it a reader its bascially a computer. It connects to the internet it takes pictures and has many other great features. very satisfied with tablet, very fast and efficient I really enjoy using this tablet it runs very well Tons of value, if you want a budget tablet look no further. We purchased this tablet for our son for Christmas, to replace a malfunctioning Kindle Fire 7. We like Kindle for our kids for the parental controls. So far, this Kindle has performed fine. He seems happy with it. Really crisp picture. Fast and good amout of storage. I got the kindle fire hd8 for my daughter for Christmas and she loves it very much The product is quite durable and user friendly in many aspects. This is our 4th kindle and we love them as \"beginner\" tablets for kids! No worries of data overages and with the sd card slot memory will no longer be an issue! My 10 year old has enjoyed playing on this. Great selection of apps and games. did not expect this kind of quality for the price I paid. very surprised. nice product. First off I can\\'t get over how much I like this one. The battery life is great the screen is nice and clear .... and bright. I would buy it again if anything ever happened to it. great compact tablet with great coclors and resolution-----decent battery life and good wi fi connectivity I love this tablet! It\\'s the perfect size. I can do everything on it and it was affordable! Can\\'t beat for price,feels expensive but isn\\'t. Does all the basics I love this tablet. The screen is so clear. So easy to read a book on. I\\'m loving my kindle fire. It does everything I need it to do and more. Works well but lacks forward control of screen and right and left movement on keyboard. Good foor short notes but could never do any substantial typing on this without external keyboard. Good for basic websurfing and email. The 8\" version is much better than the older 7\" version. Better graphics and faster processor Better then a E-book, more options and versatility I haven\\'t used a product like this and man I have to tell u it\\'s better than apple products This was exactly as advertised and did everything that was claimed. Setup was fast and easy and I have no complaints. Love this tablet for streaming, facebook, games and general web surfing. The apps are available on the amazon underground, not google playstore, so some apps that you may be used to using, may not be available on amazon underground. Overall, great tablet for the price. Would recommend. The screen is vibrant and clear. It is fast and doesn\\'t lag when going onto different sites. If you have Amazon Prime this is the tablet for you as it gives you access to unlimited, music, movies, and tv. Awesome purchase! Great size and storage for reading my online books Great price on a good tablet... especially on Black Friday The HD8 is a Great tablet. I purchased two for my daughter\\'s. The tablet feels durable to touch. The screen picture is crisp and clear. My grandson loved it. I had the smaller one but wanted to larger one for him. I received this as a gift. One of the best I\\'ve ever received. I bought two of these Fire Tablets for gifts for my sons. They are both thrilled with the features. They use them for gaming, music, photo albums, emails and online activities. The HD is what sold me. I have a Kindle Fire 2nd generation and I enjoyed mine so much since 2012, I looked into getting this one. I gave my husband this tablet for Christmas. He is very pleased with the product. He likes it much better than the last tablet that I purchased him 3 years ago. He highly recommends the product. Purchased due to reviews and in sale. So far easy to use. The Fire HD tablet is a good product. The screen has good viewing angles and the display is on point. However, the major issue I have are you have to be online to make any setting changes to the tablet.; and the advertisements that show up on the home screen is a downer. So, the rating of a 4 star is pushing for me. It\\'s such a great tablet !!! Love the picture and everything about it is amazing. I\\'m glad I chose this one and what a great deal I got on Black Friday Bought for a 6 years old she loves it and is always on it great starter tablet My 6 year old got it for Christmas and is able to use it very well Gift for daughter. She loves it. Just opened so as far as I know it will be a great purchase. Great product as usually ... better screen and faster than my previous. Work with my chromecast .. easy to use This my second kindle .. it\\'s light and faster than my previous kindle ..came with free audio books for 30 days which is cool ... better screen .. it does seem to be long than wider .. which I\\'m ok with and I got this on sale for 60 .. great deal I used to watch youtube on my phone and wife decided I needed something bigger. I seem to like it very much. I did buy a micro sd card for it. I previously had a nook that died and tried the Fire and I was hooked. Great price and lots of things to do PICKED THIS TABLET UP ON BLACK FRIDAY. WHAT A GREAT DEAL. WORKS AWESOME AND HAS ALL OF THE AMAZON APPS. Second one, bigger, better, easy as pie to set up. I bought this orange Fire Hd8 on Black Friday so it was at a great price. My husband likes it a lot. It was purchased as a replacement for his previous Fire 7 tablet that was having charging issues. I\\'ve heard of a several others having the similar issues so hopefully this model lasts longer and has an improved charging port. Bought it for my dad who loves tech that his life easier the alexa integration is fantastic. Purchased this as a gift for my father and he\\'s loving it. bought two for the family and they connect easily and work surprisingly fast for a small price. I use my fire hd8 to download books from the library. Easier to read than on my smartphone. We bought this to replace my children\\'s aging Ipads and they\\'re very happy. I was looking for a easy to use tablet for a beginner and this met my needs . Bought this during black Friday sale offer, was a good purchase and cheap. The Kindle Fire HD is an impressive Product. It is faster than my Samsung tablet. I know I will enjoy using it. I just wish that Amazon Prime music had a downloadable app for it. It is great , I like it very much. I can find anything you want. Enjoy the pad and its options. Its a great starter pad for kids. Downloading is a breeze, works quick and effective for what I bought it for. Very pleased. if you had a kindle fire 1st. this one is mush better.with all the new stuff inside . I bought two of these for the grandkids, I was going to show them how to set them up, didn\\'t need to! ilovemy kindle 8\" . However it has crash a couple of times and am not sure why. also the 8\" case is not made for this kindle because the clamps used to hold it are right on the buttons to turn on and volume. so if you have a better case for it please let me know. Works very well. Cheaper than an iPad and works great for apps and video. This was so easy to set up and the print can easily be adjusted to extra large. My 78 year old dad was really happy with his first experience with technology. He is now surfing the net and reading news online. Highly recommended. horrible...just like the other 7 i have owned ONLY due to warranties I got 2 of these for my 8 and 9 year old daughters and I love them and so do they LOVE BEING ABLE TO MAKE SPECIFIC PROFILES FOR MY CHILDREN We love the kindle fire HD8. it can have various profiles to accomodate all people who uses it in our family household. it is also very easy to set up Bought this Kindle because of the great price. Good thing, because I dropped the other one without the case on it and it cracked. I purchased this as alight weight replacement for my laptop. It has accomplished everything I needed. I\\'m sure there will be something\\'s I still need HP for, but this is a great tablet for what I needed. I got a case and 64gig card also. Everything works seamlessly so far. I upgraded my mother\\'s 3rd generation Amazon Kindle Fire HD 7\" to this new one and she likes the display being bigger to 8\" and is much faster. My husband bought this on Black Friday at a really great price! He loves how lightweight this is, and offers him his email, internet functionality and books, of course. Great buy! This fire is much better than the old one so far. It responds much faster and has a much better screen. I also put a 128 gig memory stick into it which the old fire could not accommodate. So far, so good. This was purchased an a reward for a job well done. Set up was easy and the functionality was perfect for my needs. I found this to be a great tablet for all ages-easy to use-great content. You cannot get a better tablet for the price and Best Buy had it on sale. Daughter loves it. Everything transferred from her Kindle to the fire. She said it is unbelievable fast. This version is a really good upgrade over the older fire tablet that we had before. Very happy with it. It is awesome play pokemon and clash use silk its awesome great present I bought as a Christmas gift for my 9 year old and she loves it. It works great and my package arrived early with no issues. I purchased this item for my son as a Christmas gift. His eyes lit up as he unwrapped it on Christmas morning. Later in the day, his older cousin had to call me and verify if he had truely received this item as a Christmas gift... I also plan on taking Best Buy up on their e - mailed offer that I received, which states that I can receive free start up service to get me started with my tech purchase. One of the best tablets on the market for its value Bought this for my six year old son for a Christmas present and he loves it. He couldn\\'t be happier it keeps him very entertained. This tablet was such a good deal definitely no complaints here. Best buy has the greatest deals love this store. Strong fast tablet. My 8 year old can manage it perfectly! Does what I wanted it to do. Really like the way it performs. Does not let me connect with my library. Very diapointed I purchased this for my wife so that she has an option other than her phone or laptop to browse the internet. I Love this tablet its Awesome and way Cool I highly recommend this to anyone Great price great value for the pricing...black friday special Inexpensive, No need to worry about it getting broken/lost It is very handy great when i don\\'t want to use a computer and i can take it anywhere Bought it for my wife and the fire does not have to be recharged as often as the paper white. she likes it bought this during black friday (actually Thursday). ok for price. but not cool i had to buy extra storage for not a great price. I started with the 7\" little brother and liked it a lot, so I decided to upgrade to the larger model. I use it primarily as an e-reader and for some net surfing and Facebook. The WiFi works great and is ready to access and use. Don\\'t buy this unit if you want cell (4g) access to the Internet. It is WiFi only. Frankly, my cell phone takes better pictures, but that\\'s not what I really wanted from the unit. All in all, a great reader with excellent battery life. A great alternative to the more expensive iPad. I prefer my paper white for reading but this is great for everything else. Great gift idea. Nice addition to the kindle family. So far it does what I want. Very happy with the price too. I read the reviews, before I purchased this item and.... So far, so GOOD! The handy-dandy case that I found on sale for 9.99, at the same time works well too. I\\'ve owned a Kindle Fire HD7 before and this newer Kindle fire didn\\'t disappoint. It does the job really well for most things and the price you pay, but don\\'t expect it to be a top of the line tablet. Everything I needed it for. Screen is nice enough and price was right. The 8-inch screen makes it very easy to use and read the print of books. Overall quality is very good. Perfect for my wife and college daughter. Very easyTo learn reader. My Dad, retired Vietnam veteran, received this as a gift and he Loves it so much. Very user friendly and great quality for the price. Picture is great. Quick response when going from site to site. Sound is not so good but what I expected from a tablet. very easy to set up and use. seems to be good quality Purchased on Black FridayPros - Great Price (even off sale)Very powerful and fast with quad core processors Amazing soundWell builtCons -Amazon ads, Amazon need this to subsidize the tablet and will remove the adds if you pay them $15.Inability to access other apps except the ones from Amazon. There is a way which I was able to accomplish to add the Google Play storeNet this is a great tablet for the money I purchased this as a gift and I\\'m had I did. This tablet far exceeds my expectations. Very pleased with my tablet. Love that it\\'s HD and user friendly. I thought twice about getting this because of people saying you have limited apps but its not to limited so I am very happy. I was able to get google youtube Netflix and all the main apps I actually care about. For the price you cannot do any better. Love it so much we ended up getting my kids each one. good for reading for a long hours since battery last over 6 hours. I will recommend it to my relatives and friendas Key to owning this tablet is having amazon prime account Easy to use and navigate. Great for watching movies and videos!! Bought two of these for my kids for Christmas. Love the level of control it gives me to supervise and monitor usage. Best deal I have seen online. I checked Amazon and they were not as good. We bought this as a gift for someone who travels often. She loves it and said the quality it as expected. Great battery life and picture quality. The camera is not the greatest but I often don\\'t use it for the camera. I usually have my phone with me so I use that instead. Can hold a lot of books too. The Amazon Fire HD8 is a great tablet at a bargain price. Purchased at Christmas time for $59. It\\'s an even better value if you have an Amazon Prime account. Only downside is the use of Amazon\\'s Appstore instead of the Google play store which has more variety. I bought 3 three of these for my boys for Christmas gifts. Great little tablet. Perfect for everything they want to use it for. Greatest small tablet. Just wanted something convenient. My wife loves her Fire Hd8 she had one of the older models so i up graded her to this new model and she feel in love with it right away The amazon kindle fire is a great reader on a budget. It has most of the basic functions of standard tablets(Ipad, galaxy tablets) at a fraction of the cost. It also has access to a huge amazon library of books. We got 2 of these tablets in black Friday for a great price! its a pro if you have amazon prime, since everything around this tablet is amazon base- shopping, videos, books, and alexa. Bought this tablet for my kiddos. Pretty good, easy to use Always a good price and good for what it\\'s meant for. Amazon Fire is great for reading my Kindle Books, checking email, facebook, or checking out the internet. Haven\\'t ck\\'d out what else I can do with it, but I\\'m sure there is a lot. Love the Amazon Fire HD tablet, easy to get around Download games, movies, education apps to help ur kids to learn to read do math problems and keep them entertained while on the road or family trips These are excellent to keep on the coffee table or taking along on a trip. Can\\'t beat the price. Definitely worth the investment...I may get a couple of more! My daughter had a smaller eight GB tablet ... this was a nice step up for her and with better graphics. We extended the memory with an SD card for photos. Bought for my son and he enjoys playing in it. He\\'s able to download all the apps he wanted and the camera is awesome. Love this Kindle. It is my fourth kindle and it is best one yet. This tablet works great and my daughter loves it. Only reason not 5 stars is because you cant access google play without rooting the tablet. Way to ruin android amazon. i use the hd8 for my personal entertainment system I have had many tablets, Samsung, Asus and old Ipad. This Fire holds its own . The Silk system is not quite as speedy but the lack of bloatware is nice. There is a hack to get more google apps. It\\'s light to hold, the ads are not invasive. I enjoy taking advantage of the Prime benefits. Simple to operate. Would recommend for everyday use and movie/reading music consumption. Christmas gift so it\\'s to early to tell, arrived on time Christmas gifts for 2 granddaughters. They loved there first ones. time for a update There are better tablets, but at this price point the Fire HD 8 is outstanding. Reasonably priced and great for the grandkids. We purchased cheaper tablets for them last year and none of them lasted! So far these are looking 100% better. This baby is a bargain. Very good screen, decent overall quality and performance...and now Alexa. I use it with Bluetooth speaker and it has become my office music machine. Hold the home button and ask Alexa to play easy jazz. No muss; no fuss. Improves upon \\'regular\\' Alexa because she has a screen now!. I got exactly what I was expecting with this purchase, a low cost device for media consumption (e-books, movies, music) with surprisingly decent performance in the few games I\\'ve tried on the device. The MicroSD expansion card slot is a must-have for me when purchasing any tablet device. This was a gift for grandchildren. I am sure they will love, seeing they used the older one we have. Most people will go with a bigger more sofisticated iPad or Samsung but this is a good product for a child to pass time or someone not wanting all the bells and whistles Perfect cheap device for kids and grandkids nice to have sitting around This Fire HD 8 is my first such device. I find it to be easy to operate and very responsive.The touch screen control takes getting used to as I often click on the wrong close part of the screen and have to go back. The Alexa voice assistant surprised me when she announcedherself over the speaker. (I shut her off since I\\'m not a fan of conversing with computers).My main complaint is that comes with nothing but a charger and cable. The wordless, pictorialstart up instructions were primitive and vague. There are no instructions on how to use thisdevice; no sample book to test and get familiar with. There is a help function thatfills in some basics of functionality but not thorough enough. The WiFi connectivity is great, using the latest protocol and encryption. It has a simple web browser but web time also seems to be the greatest drain on the battery. The cable can be used toattach to a Windows PC and transfer files (books, music, pictures etc). I would also recommend buying a protective case for if its ever accidently dropped. This Fire tablet is a nice upgrade to the one I purchased 3 years ago. The screen is great, it is very fast, has lots of storage with the SD card, and just an all-around good product. And a great value. This tablet is an easy device to download sites and convenient too! Purchased the 8 inch Fire tablet during Black Friday and have been using it since. A great deal. Doesn\\'t disappoint. Nice features. Owned two prior to this one. Very nice tablet. This is my first tablet and I\\'m excited about learning how to use it. I have not used it a ton yet but I am very happy with my experience so far. This is great for an 8 yr old. She had out grown her Nabi and likes taking pictures this does just the trick. The memory can be extended to hold more pictures. Great tablet. I started out with an original kindle and wanted one with backlight and the price was too good to pass up! I LOVE my fire! I subscribe to both Amazon Prime and Netflix, and it\\'s perfect for those. Plus you can add additional memory cards. I have bought iPads for everyone in my house, and bought this for myself and am in heaven. The camera isn\\'t good though, but I don\\'t use it. For the money, this is an incredible value. Black Friday deal. Great alternative for my 2 IPads. Great stuff to have. It is a good tool to help your kids go out and find knowledge! And this does help. Wanting knowledge should still be encourage. First time user and very pleased. Great for me because of my book downloads. Not too big and not too small. This Kindle fire is amazing. I love how kindlely and fiery it is. Great value for such a well made tablet. Everything you need for a low price I purchased this tablet and am very happy with it. We bought this Fire HD to replace an older model and the kids love it. Ease of use and the integration with Amazon Prime makes the product worth every moment. It is mostly used to watch movies and play some games so it works well for what is needed. Great for the price but if you need more options as far as productivity goes you may want to stick with an iPad or Galaxy Tab. This product my not fully compare to more expensive tablets, but Amazon has made improvements that provide a platform to watch media and read. Further, Amazon has made significant strides to provide a music platform which also improves the value of this tablet. Loved the Fire HD7 but the latest HD8 is sharper, faster and still handles great. Easy to use tablet. Good price. Great for beginners as well as intermediate users. Fun! Great product simple easy to understand great value!!!! I bought this tablet as a replacement for my wife\\'s Fire TV HDX 8.9 as her battery life is starting to decrease as it is getting older. Unfortunately, she was not happy with it as the tablet is slightly smaller screen wise (the next step is 10\" which is way too big, and has 4 less hours of battery life) and I was disappointed despite it being a newer tablet it was not able to decode HEVC, like the Fire TV 2015 boxes we have connected to our televisions. This unfortunately is a show stopper, as we can\\'t view the movie library we have on this tablet. We will wait until a newer version comes out that is improved. Great price and good quality screen image in a nice 8\" format. I installed a 128 GB microSD card with no problems. I was impressed with the quality of the device and it fit a generic tablet cover that was too big for the 7\" generic tablet I had previously purchased. I wished I had gotten a few more during the black Friday sale. It came with a charger and cable. Great tablet/e-reader. You can do a lot on this bad boy!! Great all around Tablet. Does a little bit of everything along with being the best e-reader around. Great quality and decent price. Love features and the fact that I can mirror my tablet on my tv with firestick. Perfect for teenage tablet, perfect for homework!! This tablet is well worth the money. It has descent performance and good screen resolution. And it is definitely a great tablet for beginners. This is the one for those who don\\'t want to spend more on tablets. Really great product. It\\'s pretty good! Did what I needed? I love this tablet. It does pretty much every thing my ipad does!!!! Hoped this Fire HD 8 would be faster than my old HD Fire...not so much, I guess I expected the new Fire HD 8 to perform better but it still lags and is slow to load information while surfing the Internet. My wife\\'s Ipad is light years ahead on this one, but what do you expect from a 60-70 dollar tablet. It works well for what I needed. I purchased for great price on black Friday. My mom had been wanting one for a while, so this was great. The 8 In Fire tablet does everything my nexus 7 tablet did; but also has the added benefit of expandable storage. Great budget tablet. Just needs good sized microsd card! Nice tablet for media consumption for the price. For Amazon user for sure I\" like it a lot, easy to use , A big improvement over the original, the price was increideble (black friday special)onclude a camera , front and rear, the quality is not as good as a cell phone, but is ok This tablet does everything it said it would. Works great. No complaints. I just wish it played .avi, but that is not really a huge problem I purchased this kindle on black friday for $60.it works very well as a reader and tablet. It has good battery life and silk is a decent option for a browser. I also side loaded the nook apponto this kindle. It works as well here as it does on my nookereader. The Amazon Fire HD8 16GB is a excellent value and performs accordingly for it\\'s price-point. It cannot be compared with a mini-ipad at a fraction of the price. The other drawback is the , limited apps as compared to the apple store or even google store. Yes, the google store can be loaded with a little difficulty. All in all for the money, it;s a nice little tablet. Has all of the functions of the expensive iPads and works great for fraction of the cost!!! After looking at several similar products, and looking at multiple reviews, the Amazon Fire HD 8 seemed like the best choice. The fact that it was on-sale one-third off on Black Friday made the final choice easy. We are very pleased with how this product works and how it met our needs for a bit larger screen. Easy for us mid-seventy year-olds to use. Upgraded my tablet to hd, previous owned the 7\" regular. I wanted a tablet so my grandkids can use instead of using my ipad. A great xmas gift. Very user friendly and straight forward instructions great for all ages I had a smaller version and this was easy to adjust to and use. Really affordable present for a kid.. Or just have around It\\'s a great tablet for the price. Fast and snappy This is a nice and cheap android device. HD display and Amazon\\'s sturdy build quality with 10 hours+ battery backup. Sometimes runs a little slow, rest is good Upgrade to my kindle fire 7, pleased with all the new features including Alexa I enjoy my Kindle immensely, so much better than having to start up my computer. Bought on Black Friday for my kids, my 3 year old can work it just fine with the kids app for watching YouTube and other videos. I picked this up as a doorbuster for my father-in-law. He has an Amazon account and can watch the movies he likes. My kids like it very much! The price is low. The tablet is light weighted. Love my Kendal but cannot find a case or screen saver for it. I am very satisfied with this tablet. I use it for browsing because the screen is larger than my phone. Caught it on sale and bought two. Good value for the money. It was recommended by a friend. Get a case for it, it is easier to hold on to. The second one will make a nice gift. This is an older tablet. I probobly expected too much. If I\\'m going to deal with lagginess I prefer my ipad2. Got this thing around Black Friday and only paid about 50 something bucks. Awesome equipment you can actually stream the web very glad I bought it can\\'t believe it so inexpensive! Great product...great price very easy to use...I got it for my nieces..they love it It is good. Some apps are not available. Easy to use. This was a gift for one of my granddaughters. She just loves this Kindle. This is the second one I\\'ve bought for her. This is a bigger and newer generation with lots more options. Fun to use and also easy for kids to use as well! Good tablet for books and games for all the family! Great tablet, perfect size, has night mode on display so you would be able to fall asleep if using at night - won\\'t keep you awake because blue light is filtered out. Response is great, colors IPS panel great, no blue tooth It\\'s a really great tablet. It even has Amazon Alexa built in, so I don\\'t have to buy Echo or Echo Dot. I originally bought it to use as a MP3 player but has so many features, I haven\\'t added any music to it. Very good for kids to learn and play games and research school work. Purchased these for my grandkids...and they absolutely love them. They can play play their games to their hearts\\' content. They ar ed really fast too. Great tablet for kids to use! Play games or read books and isn\\'t slow. I got this kindle because I broke my Fire 7\\'. It took some getting use to since the screen was bigger but overall it was a great purchase. Pretty happy with this so far. Like the fact that you can add memory. I love my new kindle fire HD8!!! It is a great tablet for all ages and easy to navigate!!!! I highly recommend this tablet for everyone!! Used for internet surfing . Does a great job, it\\'s great! Perfect price for the tablet and recommend for kids who don\\'t take care of electronics. Purchased a I-Pad and the kids broke it and was out $600.00. If they break the tablet I can purchase another on at the low cost at Best Buy. Picked this up during Black Friday and for the price is a great starter tablet for my kids Our tablet is fast and works very well. I am pleased with the amount of apps that Amazon offers. This tablet is really good for the price, especially on the holidays. If you are a movie watcher or just using it for games it has great speed with a quad core. Highly recommend so e-book as well. Very happy with my purchase I bought 3 already. My amazon fire is amazing, it is fast and is durable. Great table I pay cheap price is gift for my son my son is happy My daughter loves this tablet. Uses it for Netflix! So impressed with the battery life on this! My phone\\'s battery is almost dead in the morning, but this thing can play music for 8 hours and the battery just goes down 20%. :) I am glad that I made this choice for both my kids: they love this gadget it has things for them to learn and play. Great thing about this is customized content for children The Amazon tablet line is possibly one of the best our there. The functionalities of android and windows with the ease of use equal to an Ipad Tmtis is the second tablet I purchased for my kids. Its perfect for all the things my kids do. Amazon fire tablet is great and easy to use. Good value! Amazing tablet for the price. Lightning quick, screen quality is great and it has a great feel to it. It\\'s only limitation it\\'s the Amazon app store. I love how you can keep up with social media and watch movies online. This is fantastic!!! My wife loves reading on the tablet. It\\'s also great for surfing the web. I bought it for friend of mine, he really liked it. Works very well. Easy to carry around & connect to wifi. needed a tv in our kitchen, wasn\\'t looking for huge or fancy for this. so the 32 inch was perfect for us Works great. Easy conversion for an aging guy without much technological experience. I bought my Fire HD just for reading. I have a Kindle Unlimited membership and wanted to keep all my books in one place. This is an amazing little tablet. How Amazon can sell these for only $89 is beyond me. And I got mine on Black Friday, so it was only $59! At that price it was a downright steal. I had the first Kindle Fire. This model is better in every way imaginable. I also own an iPad Pro 9.7\". I don\\'t try to compare the Fire with the iPad, they are completely different devices. But for what the Fire is, I love it every bit as much as I love my Pro! I bought this as an upgrade from my old Kindle. Works awesome, i can even watch movies through my Amazon Prime. Plenty of apps to choose from. Awesome little tablet. Great beginner tablet for all ages. Easy to use by all ages. Bought this for our 8 year old for Christmas. Looks like he\\'s going to love it! Bought this for my niece for Christmas. I\\'m sure she will love it! Newest version of Kindle Fire product line is a hit. Larger screen for not much money, good screen resolution and longer battery life. No problems, and I\\'m a happy reader! Only cost me $59 at Black Friday. Good deal. Way cheaper than an iPad of which I have several. This was for my young kids. The only knock I have has to do with the you tube kids app for this vs apple products. On apple, you tube kids allows you to speak your search. You only have the option to type the search in for this which is problematic for young children who cannot read or write I am very happy with my product. It\\'s nice fancy HD is very cool. I am able to see and read my books in full format now. Thank you. This is a gift to my wife for xmas, don\\'t know yet if she likes it but I can\\'t see why she wouldn\\'t I was pretty impressed with this little device. It was easy to setup and works rather well. I had also bought a IPad Air 2 with 128GB during BF for $375. After playing around with the HD Fire I returned the Air 2 because it met my needs at a much lower price. I added a 64GB SD card and am downloading movies from Netflix. The HD display is very clear. Battery life could be a little better but overall I\\'m very satisfied with it. The free stuff you get with an Amazon Prime account is icing on the cake. I dig it! Easy to set up. Perfect size. Easy to read font. Price was affordable. Great gift idea for the adults on my Christmas list. Nice size tablet. Very easy to use. Love it!!!!! Beats my laptop. Love the tablet not to small, lightweight, and is easy to use. This tablet is the best you can buy for the money. Great apps, great picture. Very nice at a great price. Love Bose products. Highly recommend. This on is much better than the original Kindle Fire it is replacing. This is a Great budget table, it has has Great features for the price I was looking for at replacement tablet and this is exactly what I needed The tablet is great the jacket not so much - doesn\\'t stand up - hate it Does everything I need thank you. Alight small package easy to take anywhere Great kindle, perfect size screen, I love using it just as much as my iPad mini and regular size iPad! Easier to travel with! This is really nice and has great clarity I like it. outstanding replacement tablet for my outdated and overpriced iPad 2 I use it everyday after work for down time......... I brought it for my grandmother and she really loves it. This is so much better than the Kindle that I purchased 3 years ago. It is much faster, and I really like how long the battery last before needing to be charged. For what it does it\\'s great for me a good alternative I wanted something for games and reading so I thought this was a great deal. I have enjoyed it so much. Passes a lot of time for me. Easy to download on too. Bought it in order to watch NBC but the NBC app isn\\'t compatible, so now I have a paperweight. Got this for my kid. Great cheap tablet. Camera aren\\'t so good but usable. Apps load quick. Love the kindles. This was a gift and a great value. I have one myself. Great tablet for my son. Live the endless library of downloadable books. If you\\'re looking for a tablet to read books & surf the Internet, this is perfect. Great for beginner and intermediate. Highly satisfied!!! awesome, great value, good quality product, I would recommend this to anyone Gift for my mom and she absolutely loves it. It was exactly what she wanted. The Amazon Fire HD8 is a super fast tablet for the money. When combined with an Amazon Prime account the true value is released. We purchased tablets for nearly every family member and linked them all through one Amazon account. This becomes an unbelievable value. This was a perfect gift for the holidays! I saw the reviews on this and immediately had to get it! I bought this on Black Friday and I have been using it for about a month. It is faster than my Fire 7 2015 most likely due to the 1.5GB vs 1GB RAM. The screen resolution is fine though not the best. At this price I am not complaining. Amazon adds some nice features as well. The advertisements are discreet and only when the fire is turned on. Not a problem at all. Even at full price this is a good deal. I bought this tablet for my 7 years old and love it. Great parental control, set up goals for the day, turns off at the time, I decided. Works perfectly and very fast processor it\\'s all i needed while away from my computer on the go and at work. Perfect for streaming and an E-reader at a great price. Love this tablet. It does everything I need it to.My problem is, I have family that falls in love with it so I give mine away. If this wasn\\'t good, I wouldn\\'t be on my 3rd one.The only thing I would change is the silly ads and even worse browser. Other than that, a solid product! We got a great deal on Fire HD 8. My kids love playing on it. This is a pretty reliable tablet especially for the price. I use most of Amazon services (Prime, Kindle, Music, Video, Alexa) and this is the best companion to access all services seamlessly. This tablet also has great features/expansion and performance. I just like reading amd playing games on it..Better then those bulky computers I have an Amazon fire tablet and love it so hopefully he will also. Pretty easy to use as your first tablet. I\\'m loving my kindle. Early gift to myself. Happy! Needed an\\xa0inexpensive and portable Alexa device and this works perfectly. Allows for reading of my Kindle lib and even plays a few games This tablet is easy to use and great for a new user. its the best tablet that you can buy for the price and you can add a memory card to it. The new Fire HD8 tablet is a great purchase for the price; it\\'s fast enough for basic browsing, and you can download prime videos to watch on the go (which is why I bought it). We use them for classes, they work great and are easy to use for our older individuals Like that downloading books is fast. I am still learning features and have not explored other positives featured. If you\\'re a Amazon frequent flyer like me, HD fire is very fun and convenient placing all aspects of Amazon at your finger tips. The only thing i dont like about it is that its slow like most tablets. does everything our other tablets do and more. Like the sharing across platforms. Purchased this for my mother. She loves it, just the right size to grab and go. Great buy for the money. I read the online reviews and compared products. Same price here as on Amazon. I liked the idea of having both my Kindle and Tablet in one. This is a great product. Very inexpensive and a great gift for children. Replaced a Nook with the fire tablet. Disappointed that I cannot use Chromecast from it. Did not realize I would be tied to amazon. But it is a good tablet so far This item is a budget friendly gift for readers and internet browsers! The gift was great since I have a 10 I knew was a good present for a very deserved person! Good speed compared to the other models just the size and weighs very little. Large viewing area for a 8\" tablet HD Works great for anything from games to movies, nice big screen to enjoy anything you are doing with it. Best gift for Beginers. Less Price and enough speed and memory. Kids like it a lot. works great for the price.but it shoves amazon stuff down your hroat like the fire tv.and is linked to your amazon 1 click buy if you haveit set up that way. I was a ook user and have been converted to kindle. The size is great and it is very responsive. Got one for me and one as a gift. I expect my tablet to be a workhorse. Available to have two or three books open that I\\'m reading, hanging on to my email and ready with summaries of the news. The new Kindle Fire does it on a larger, brighter page. It is a work horse more than worth the money.. It goes with me might and day. I don\\'t know what I\\'d without this gem. My nephew is 3 years old and this is a great starter tablet. He is gonna be so excited Christmas morning. I replaced my old kindle as it took a power failure hit. The new kindle has been updated and it is easier to download the e-books. I am learning some of the new updates but it appears to be more user friendly than my old one. Customer Service for the Kindle is available 24/7 and they are very helpful. You can get a review about any book before you purchase it. No returning books to the library. Excellent value for small laptops. Lenovo 11.2\" screens with flash memory & Microsoft Word for 1 year. This is a new tab upgrade for me as I have had my previous Kindle for over 7 years and love it. Have been very pleased with all aspects of the Fire HD8. Good performance for the low price. This was a gift for my wife. She loves it. She uses it everyday. Holds a great charge. Great little product for the price. Not the best camera, but it doesn\\'t claim to be. . Nice tablet for the price. Just wish it had bluetooth. Can\\'t beat the price on this Fire Tablet HD8! Very good display. awesome gift and perfect for kids or older adults easy to use I had an older Kindle fire and had to upgrade as it eventually died. I love the convenience of books when I travel, along with any apps I want. exactly what I was looking for. My old tablet stopped working so the value of the Amazon Fire at Best Buy was too much to pass up Bought as a gift for my daughter. and s he loves it. I was reluctant to replace my previous Kindle Fire because I wasn\\'t sure I would like it as well. I am pleased to say I\\'m loving it! I bought Kindle fire for my grandson who is 24. I have one and he thought great can do so much on it. For the price you can\\'t beat it. I use more then computer. Use it for what it is necessary. That is all I need. Great Tablet for occasional users who want to Watch Movies, Read books, and browse the web. I already own one but bought another for my sister in law for Christmas. I have really enjoyed it so far. While not perfect by any means it is certainly worth the price. Works better than what I expected. Able to surf the net and watch movies. The battery life and screen are awesome. Bought this for under 60 bucks and looking to buy more to give as a gift I purchased the Fire Tablet to temporarily replace an iPad and an LG tablet that were destroyed. My 7-year-old won\\'t put it down--he can play all his favorite games, read Kindle books, and watch YouTube videos (as long as he has wi-fi access). It\\'s holding up well. Good price. I bought this for my wife. She had a Barnes and Noble Nook, this took it\\'s place. She uses the Kindle Fire daily from reading books and playing games to looking up things on the web. She lives it. The Amazon fire hd 8 is great. Much faster than the fire 7. I am really enjoying this device, I wanted something to use for entertainment purposes when camping. Something small yet powerful and this works perfect. 5 stars if your a prime member like me that way you can take advantage of the many thing prime has to offer yet still have available almost every other digital services out there. Would and have recommended this product. Tablet had trouble from the begging it kept restarting and rebooting I had to return it. if you like the old kindle fire it just like the new one but better, better screen and more space I\\'m not going to say this is the best tablet out there,but,for my wifes needs,it is perfect. It does everything she wants to do and more. Got it for $60 during black Friday. I also have 7inch fire tablet. For few more bucks this tablet is way better than the 7 inch non HD fire. I truly enjoy this product. I have an older one but this is superb in all areas of entertainment. Good tablet. Gave as gift and person enjoys it. Recommend I bought one last year for one cousin and had to continue for another this year. Great buy imo. it is small enough to carry in your purse and open up a whole new world while waiting at appointments. Looks pretty solid will update review as soon as gift is opened . We have one for each of my children so I bought this one for my mother. They are amazing tablets especially for the price! Purchased mainly to use travelling so haven\\'t really had the opportunity to give it a fair road test at this point. It was advertised as capable of downloading movies and books so you can watch/read while travelling without burning through your data or being hit with data roaming fees or having to purchase wifi during flights. Got these on black Friday for early Christmas gifts. Very good buy on a pretty good tablet. Gift for my mom and she had no problem learning to use. The best tablet for the price! All three of my children have one & they are worth it! Purchased as a gift for my nephew He\\'s was very happy with this item no complaints Works better than the 7\" Amazon Fire tablet I have. Better screen, faster processor and bigger to boot. I bought one for my boyfriend and one for his son. It\\'s fast and easy to use. This was a gift and they love it! Its compact, they can surf the web, play games check emails etc This my 2nd Kindle. I am so happy with it. The price was right and I could not resist buying another. I like it a lot, it works well for everything I need. I would like a bigger selection of apps. Bought this for someone as a gift. They are big on amazon kindle so this was a huge plus with other features and amazon store improving. They love it.I know other tablets have kindle apps but this was an awesome price. BOUGHT MINE ON BLACK FRIDAY AND IT IS AWESOME. MY FIRST TABLET AND IT IS GREAT WITH ALL OF THE AMAZON FEATURES. my kids have this. it works okay for things like youtube or netflix. Apps take longer to load and many games that you can get for the iPad aren\\'t available on the Fire Tablet. Still say go with Mac. So easy to use and can do so much more than just read on it I received this as a gift after my original Kindle Fire started giving me trouble after 4 1/2 years and wouldn\\'t hold a charge. This new Kindle Fire 8 is fantastic! The larger size makes it easier to read. The \"buttons\" are better than the old one. I like that is has more \"perks\", i.e. camera, that my old one didn\\'t have. It\\'s nice to be able to read, play games, browse the internet, or check email or take photos. The battery lasts for days! I definitely recommend this. Bought for college student as substitute for text books. Works great! This is a Christmas gift for my granddaughter. I purchased this one because I heard a lot of good things about it and the price was great on black Friday. Got a great deal on black friday. This is the best affordable tablet for under 100. Was able to get advertisements off from Amazon and installed playstore. Wife bought a cheaper cover for this tablet. Love the Amazon environment. Want to buy another one if they come down in price again! My two oldest (10 & almost 8) love these tablets and I love the FreeTime subscription from Amazon! My Aunt is 86 and has never used a computer. She does not have internet at her house. But she loves to read and loves to learn and now will be challenged while learning to use her new Kindle. If you are in the Amazon ecosystem, the Fire HD8 is a great choice for an inexpensive tablet. Very responsive, good screen, and so far the battery life has been great. The only drawback of the Fire is the apps are only available from the Amazon App Store, not the Google Play Store. For example, there is no Gmail application to install. But that\\'s not what I use this for... Kindle reading, Netflix viewing, occasional Facebooking and light web browsing are well suited to this device. Can\\'t beat it for $89. My whole family uses these tablets. We love them and with Prime it is awesome. I like this tablet it\\'s easy to use Easy for the kids It works just right. My husband loves it too. It does well with my kids. Runs Great, very efficient for what we use it for. Got everything on here and then some!!!!!!!!!!!!!! My kids have the older model fire, smaller version. They can spend hours on it. This is bigger, better version with a larger screen size. Each child is getting a different color so they know whose is which. Durable, works great enjoy using it for books and audio books I previously owned a Samsung Tab3. As a media device (for reading, viewing, listening, playing), the HD8 is fine, even a step up in screen size, clarity, and ease of navigation. However, the proprietary nature of Amazon\\'s apps basically eliminates (for me) using it for work (e-mail, document & spreadsheet storage/retrieval/editing). Since I didn\\'t buy it for its work capabilities, that\\'s fine, but I think that would be annoying to a specific segment of potential users. At some point I will probably spring for a more-expensive updated Samsung tablet (or Windows Surface, if I\\'m feeling reckless), and the HD8 will probably be passed on to my 9-year-old. I am so impressed with this tablet. My seven year old loves its app, gaming and e-reader functions. Easy to use reading device. Looking forward to watching movies on it. Great value My girl loved it, she loves that its linked to echo It\\'s was good for handling light weight and comfortable in hand. Good audio clarity, video everything is good. But only few supportable apps. Need more apps which we use generally. Great alternative to iPad Mini. Great for Amazon Prime members I had gotten this primarily to watch movies and run some basic internet programs. I have been very pleased to date with the speed of the processor and picture quality. Just what my grandson wanted. Perfect price, can\\'t wait until he opens it Has worked out well. Very user friendly. Would buy again. Great price as well. Great tablet for the money! Thought to beat the screen resolution My Kindle Fire HD meets my reading and web needs!! This is a great device for my sons games since he was always using my iphone. Lots of good features for the Amazon member. Tablet is nice and fast. Great tablet for under $100. HD quality and it works just as good as any tablet. Bought two for my grandkids, a 10 year old boy. He does a lot of AR reading on this kindle fire tablet for school. As well as play games. He loves it and his parents are pleased with his eagerness to read. Tablet work great, good battery life. Just not a lot storage, but has micro SD card slot. Was told by sales person I could come back in a week with receipt to get $30 off (Black Friday price). Customer service lady said they don\\'t do that. I was misled. Item itself is okay. Great Kindle, my wife had the originally one and this one is better in every way. I purchased this tablet on thanksgiving day when I was already in the store buying a new cell phone. It was on sale $59. I am very pleased with my purchase. I am already an Amazon prime member so it links up to my account. I am very happy with my purchase and recommended to my brother who bought the same day I did:) I really like the Fire 8 tablet but there are some issues to be aware of. Amazon seems to subsidize the low cost of the item by requiring you to be solicited by ads and and use their apps. Every time you activate it, the screen display is a full size ad that goes away when you swipe the screen. There is no Google Play so you can only download apps chosen by Amazon at their Appstore. Otherwise, pretty cool for the money. I got this for my birthday and I love it. I love the resolution, size and blue light setting. I am now thinking on buying one for my four year old nephew as a Christmas present, I only need to buy a sleeve. This is a great gift for my 6 year old nephew. He will enjoy it for hours. Clear screen, color and size, grandson loves to play games on it and I like to have it with me to view emails during commercials while watching tv. I need a table that had more memory to start with. This fit the bill. I had a kindle before but mine did not have a camera like this one . This make it easier to capture picture instead of having to stop and use my phone. Pros: 5 Ghz wifi, supports expansion cardsCons: app store a little limited though there is apparently a workaround Other: the ads fed from Amazon are not terribly intrusiveOverall, the tablet seems to work well and is a good value, This item is perfect for online reading and internet browsing. The only con is that Amazon doesn\\'t have some of the apps that Google Play has. The camera is not very sharp , and you can not download another one . Bought for my mom, shes in love with it. Use for netflix myself love the 8\\' great size and cpu speed. Love my new kindle bought it to replace a 7 inch and I love it. Love my Kindle. It has taken over the place of my laptop completely with all other added benefits. This is our 5th kindle. We love these. They are easy to use and the screen is a nice size. They are lightweight and great for reading. Works great even in OK network areas. Long battery life and easy to use. Would definitely recommend to a friend. I purchased this for my daughter for Christmas. I own one as well and I love it. First time with a tablet, wanted one for years just to watch Netflix and basic games. Very happy, the screen looks great and the speaker is loud. So far, so good! Great HD features. Makes it easy to travel with and be on the go and see all your shows. i like the tablet only thing is im not a fan of the amazon app store. wish it had google play. I know my granddaughter will love it. She has an older one that was given to her For the most part I like the tablet. Got it for my mother. The con is you have to use Amazon for apps. The amazon fire HD is great choice for a beginner or not so tech savy person! I like the low light mode the extra memory and a great price compared to the others This fits perfect in my purse and love how clear the screen is. The price was amazing, didn\\'t find it anywhere else close the the price. Nice tablet but as usual with these items no instructions on how to get started It\\'s very good product and I recommended this to buy it. Best bang for your buck............................ Excellent pick up during the Black Friday Sales. Not too big not to small. This tablet bundled up with Amazon Prime service is a great combo of inexpensive entertainment. I had a very small nano and needed to have more space for songs that are just coming out and so far I love it. Didn\\'t really need the bigger one because I have a phone that will do most of those things. Works very well for light tablet use and great for reading. Fire 8 HD 2016 is great. Very easy to maneuver. Easy to use and transition from original Kindle Fire. Much more versatile than the original. Really glad I upgraded. Ok tablet from amazon, added Google play to device for more apps. Google how to do this. I bought this item for my nephew and he loves it. I have the old version of the fire hd and I love it as well. It\\'s way cheaper than buying an apple tablet. We haven\\'t had any problems with it. Well worth your money Bought it for my daughter and she can\\'t put it down. Great for nextflix I had a kindle for about 4 years, I\\'ve been wanting a fire hd for sometimes, because of all the features. I can honestly say that I love my fire hd. still playing with it, figuring out what I can & can\\'t do. I love the tangerine color I got. One thing for sure, some apps I have on my phone like redbox & instagram they are not in the amazon app store so I can\\'t put them on the tablet. Wish I could. Working great as a first tablet for my grandson. He loves it Very fast tablet. Large screen but can held by 1 hand. Great for movies and videos, as well as candy crush and other resource hogging apps. It starts CC way faster than my LG G3 phone. The display is very clear and crisp. The amazon android modified OS is good once you get used to it. I have one screen containing all apps, and you can put these in groups too. so 1 screen is all you will need. then you have the other panels for Amazon mandated stuff like Prime movies, music, pictures. It\\'s pretty cool compared to my previous Acer 8\" tablet with reg Android. Could not easily install Chrome, but I\\'m getting use to the SILK browser and it will work very well for my needs. Great Tablet and highly recommended. Definitely an amazing deal at an amazing price on Black Friday weekend Amazing product from Amazon within budget and get the best outcome of it It was by far the best deal out there for the money very happy I purchased the Kindle Fire 8\" after owning a 7\" for several years. I love the bigger screen and added features in this version. Bought this for my daughter. It is inexpensive and user friendly. I use it all the time while she\\'s at school. Easy to use and elegant in design. Perfect Gift for Kids. Just decent tablet... working fast, but it needs more language support and apps as well... I bought the fire 7 inch last year and this one is better. My wife and kids love it. Easy to use. Great for the price. Good product I would recommend it to everyone thank you Thought this would be a great gift for the kids and the price was right I bought this on Black Friday for 60 bucks and wasn\\'t expecting too much at that price point. This isn\\'t as good as a iPad but at that price it\\'s pretty close and worth every penny. Bought this for a Christmas gift. Have heard good things about them and it was a recommended buy. It is awesome with low price and high quality. My daughters like it very much. Had just the fire like HD better. More movies and better quality. still learning, previously used a nexus7. Like the larger screen. Reading kindle books on it is good too. Bought for our 6 year old. Great parental controls allow you to keep track and monitor use. Would recommend for others to get for their children The product was on sale for Black Friday. Serves its purpose. Quality is good and I use it with my Chromecast. Makes a great gift. My children love them and never put them down. excellent tablet for this price is wonderfull and great performance Had to buy a new kindle because on my fire hd 7 the battery quit holding a charge. Was told there was nothing you could do. It\\'s easy to use. I can check my email, play games from AppStore, headlines news, amazon deals & offers. Very reasonable price. Purchased this for my grandson. It works great and is used mainly for reading and games. Easy to setup with no problems to register and get online. I love this tablet! love my ipad , too, but this is much lighter weight and easier to slip in my purse. I went for a 32g but there were none in stock, so I got the 16 and a memory card that I will probably never need! Love it fast , pictures look fab. love the battery life fast, easy to use, very sensitive, google play store captable, I will buy again Great tablet for the cost, does all the basic functions great. These are email, web surfing, and social media. If you belong to Amazon Prime then it\\'s even better since this thing makes it easy to take advantage of the extra content you can access. Movies, TV Shows, music, books. A lot of this is free for Prime Members. Good idea and business move for Amazon as it encourages Amazon content and purchases. The tablet itself is pretty good, smaller and more narrow than an iPad. Easy to hold in one hand, screen is nice for video, reading, web surfing and email. If the iPad is setting the bar and is a 10, I would give this an 7-8. The weakest thing is the camera, it adequate but you smart phone is better. A feature it has that the iPad lacks is the ability to add an Micro SD Card for extra space. It is also much cheaper than an iPad. I bought this for my 7 year old when her Samsung tablet stopped charging. I love the design. Only problem so far is that it randomly freezes and sometimes the volume button won\\'t respond. Other than that, great for the price. Fire tablets never disappoints! Great price, used my certificate points which helpedAlways best price at best but Most of the Kindles I have purchased have been gifts, but this one was for me. It is just what I expected from the reviews. Great tablet for the money. very good product in its price range affordable and very good The tablet works fine. But speakers are not that great If you want a good cheap tablet that works this is it. For the price guy cannot beat it great for watching videos or streaming television. I love the light weight for the size! Fun tablet!!! I really wanted to give this device a chance but I did end up returning it. It\\'s a HUGE upgrade though over the cheaper 7\" version. Honestly I don\\'t think anyone should purchase that. If your budget can handle getting this version and you are heavily invested in the Amazon ecosystem (i.e. Prime member) this will make a great tablet. I think it is intended more for kids though than adults. Having iPads in the house we tried this with our toddler as a cheaper tablet for her but the interface and quirks of the Amazon OS just were not worth the hassle. Will end up seeking out a used iPad Mini 2 instead of this. Inexpensive tablet. Funtional and great for reading. It has the blue screen that make it great for reading. Great graphics for price compared to other brands. Purchased for my nephew for Christmas. I know he will enjoy it. After I read the reviews there are a variety of things he can do on it for a 13 year old. Purchased this for my nephew for Christmas. After reading reviews, I think this will be a good device for reading books and listening to music. Upgraded from a6\" inch Fire HD. For 89.00 I don\\'t think you can find a better tablet value. Resolution is very sharp, audio is good, and it is a good size. My first tablet and it is just perfect for a beginner like me. Easy to use and just the right size. I use it when I just need to check something quickly on the internet without having to turn on my desk top computer. Very fast. great tablet for a great price and size. Would highly recommend ! Great over all Tablet! Good build quality, but cheap enough for the kids to use / loose. Really a plus for travel. Install VLC media player from the amazon app store, and then you have unlimited movie options for up to12 hours. Add some head phones and that 6 hour trip to Disneyland, well it\\'s so much more tranquil for the adults. The screen is a good size (portable but large enough to read) and has excellent resolution and color quality, the wireless connection is good and the user interface is relatively clear and easy to learn. Bought two of these for my grandson and grand daughter and they love them. I like the parental controls and the apps. Perfect device for my kids. Easy to use with lots of features. We had a few other tablets for my wife and all were very poor. We returned two and landed on this one, she has LOVED it, so much more than the others in this price range. I have had two previous kindles since they where first available. I really like all the new upgrades. The screen is very crisp and clean. The color is great. Much easier to look for books. This tablet is great! Nice display, and you get the amazon eco-system. Now you can also download google play easily, so you have the best of both worlds. I was unsure about getting a tablet but after purchasing the Amazon Fire I was convinced that I had made the right choice and have been very happy ever since. I was concerned that I had a lot to learn but it came quickly to me and I really like the screen size. It was a great buy! For the low price it is very speedy and has sufficient storage space.While it doesn\\'t have Google play, the Amazon app store has most of the same apps or a workable alternatve. We are really pleased with this tablet. The color is great. At this price point it is very good. But having being used ipad the display doesnt look sharp. Amazon app store lacks content. Overall good for my 9 yr old. This is a great tablet!!! I absolutely would recommend it to a friend!! I would buy it again!! The tablet works good.. good price point .. would buy again I enjoy readi,g and Facebook using this item. I also purchased my husband one. I love my fire! Does all that I need it to and more!!!! However only four stars because I can\\'t get rid of the ads on my lock screen unless I pay $15. it does have a lot of glare but I don\\'t mind the glare too much! Speed is great lots of storage!; This table is great for social media like facebook, check emails, watch YouTube , and in general good enough for the price! It works great for all my needs to check my emails A little more space on outer edges would be great. I only use it for gaming and have had 1 real problem. At times it kicks me out of the game (popular game from EW) Otherwise great for what I do. Needs more security. But overall good purchase for less than 100$. For the price you really can\\'t beat this tablet. The picture looks good, amazon has a great game, movie and music catalog. So if your looks big for something just to view movies on, play games or surf the web get this one because for the price it can\\'t be beat! Brought it for my son & Does EXACTLY what i want it to do. Bought this as a replacement for the 7\", faster and better display.... Best upgrade I wanted something bigger than my phone for reading. I was looking at the kindle fire, and the regular kindle e-readers. I liked the paperwhite and voyager, but they didn\\'t have the ability to play audiobooks. I decided to go with the fire because even though it will be mostly used for reading, I can do many other things with it for a cheaper price. love it i got it for my kids its more durable than a apple table I love the product. I\\'m very happy but I would like even more if the page number was displayed when reading books on this tablet, in case I wanted to refer back to a certain page. upgraded my 3 year old kindle- same old. doesnt seem that great of a difference. the graphical interface still sucks but its decent for reading. I have been a Kindle Fire user for years. This new one is amazing. I like being able to store information on a SD card. We like the battery endurance. The new 8\" screen is great too. I am very happy with this tablet. It\\'s a good size for me and easy to read and use. The wifi would drop often to where I could not listen to Spotify or other services without buffering. I was contemplating to buy either the insignia 10.1 or the Fire Hd8, I\\'m so glad I chose the latter. It is so fast and sufficient for my needs. I also downloaded Google play on the tablet even making this a better purchase. For $59, you can\\'t go wrong with this purchase. Its cheap, but the you will notice the low screen resolution compared to iPad. App is somewhat limited unless you side load it. Went in to look at the 10\\' Kindle Fire and couldn\\'t resist the price on this one. There wasn\\'t a big enough size difference to justify spending more than 200.00 for the 10 inch. This has been a great device so far. Battery life, ease of use, etc I had to return my device due to WIFI signal dropping, maybe I just had a bad unit. I\\'m disappointed that it doesn\\'t have a mirror display mode. I purchased this for my dad as a birthday present. I opened it and set it up for him and it works great. It\\'s fast enough for an Internet browser, and possibly a student. I have been wanting to purchase a tablet for light web browsing, reading, and to watch videos, something easier to carry than my laptop. This tablet is fast & the videos stream in great (as long as you have good Wi-Fi connection). Easy access to Amazon too. First, I would like to say I own iPads, iPhone, and many things Apple. Second, I also own many android devices. The main reason for this tablet was to take advantage of the lending library that comes Amazon prime. Over all I would purchase this over an iPad mini any day just for the value alone. At first I thought the display wouldn\\'t be up to snuff compared to my iPad, but for movies and reading, it was good enough that it doesn\\'t take away from the experience. However, there are a few annoying \"features\" that are on but can and should be turned off. The \"on-deck\" is a great feature, but I would have liked to have known it was downloading tons of movies in the background, eating up space and bandwidth. A better function would have been to let us choose what to download, instead of getting movies Willynilly. Be sure to turn this off when you get your tablet or it will run slow, and you\\'ll be thinking the tablet is slow. Ok on to kindle for reading. Unfortunately, reading isn\\'t as great as I thought it would be because it doesn\\'t allow scrolling. Works on kindle devices but not on kindle fire devices. If you don\\'t mind flipping the page, then you won\\'t have a problem, but for me, can read much faster by scrolling. One last point, most of the apps aren\\'t as polished under the \"Amazon Store\" as in the Google play store. I know this because I have an Nexus phone and compared them. For example, the Hue app doesn\\'t even work from Amazon Store. Anyway, this point shouldn\\'t deter you from buying it cause there are solutions. Bought this for my father who would have trouble using a computer. He\\'s picking up on it very quickly. It keeps him entertained. Good reliable device. it would be nice to have full app library, but it does what you need This is a great tablet for kids and adults alike.! Got this for my 3 year old and 7 year old and they love it. I have education apps and books that reads to them or they can read along. I would recommend getting a case for it if it\\'s for the little ones just to keep it protected. impulse purchase but a good one. good fit with amazon account that we already had. nice screen, easy to navigate This gift was for my mother in law. Initially I had to help her set it up, but she loves it and can now program it all by herself. Recommeneded! For its price, this a great little tablet. It does have limitations on what it can do and what apps are available for use with it which is the only reason I gave it 4 rather than 5 stars. Hopefully Amazon will allow it to perform better soon. This suited my exact needs which was a mobile way of watching netflix. I thoroughly enjoy this table! Easy to operate, plenty of memory, and I can use it for anything that I typically use a computer for. Great for airline flights, viewing offline amazon or Netflix shows and reading books. Video quality fine for personal viewing. It has been one of the best purchases ever. It is very simple to use. This is my first android tablet. It works pretty good though don\\'t expect it to work like an iPad. The ads are extremely annoying, but that\\'s not Best Buy\\'s fault. For me this tablet is an extremely good value! iPads are beautiful things, and they seem to just work really well all the time. But they are expensive! Same thing with Android tablets. You can get a cheap Android tablet, but then you\\'re left with a cheap tablet...poor quality displays, questionable hardware, limited support. I think Amazon hit the spot with their line of Fire Tablets - this HD8 in particular. It\\'s good quality, has a great display, it\\'s quick and snappy, has great battery life. Also being an Android based operating system, there is flexibility like accessing storage, side loading third party apps, even installing Google Play (for those who begrudge the lack of that feature, it can be done). Much more flexibility than you get with an Apple product, at a much lower price than the industry standard Samsung etc. Coming from using Apple products for so long, this thing is really convincing me that there are really viable options other than Apple, and especially for the price, its a great introduction to a different platform. Not only that, it\\'s genuinely a good product! The tablet works great so far. The parent features are nice also. suggested by the sales associate I\\'m glad I took his suggestion I gave this Amazon Fire HD8 as a retirement gift for my friend and she absolutely loves it!! Bought it for my daughter and she loves it great product at a great price! Easy, fast and efficient.great lil tablet in this price range for anyone. Purchased the Amazon Fide HD8 as a gift for my dad, who has been overjoyed with it. The display looks great and it offers him access to many of the features he looks for in a tablet, from e-books, streaming video or online shopping. The price is low because Amazon\\'s OS is restrictive, but for simple or specific needs, this product is great. Got this for my wife. She uses it daily to read She really lokes it. great tablet for kids, and for the price a great value. This is a great tablet for the price. I have one that I purchased a few years ago and use it much more than my laptop. Recently purchased two more for gifts. Does the job when I travel and I would recommend to a friend This is my fifth Kindle and with each new one I have a new feature to use. I like my tablet. Been doing a lot more reading than normal with it. Only disspoinment is that my TV has automatic Chromecast and you cannot cast to it on my Toshiba TV. Works on others. TVs. I like it. Perfect tablet for my 8 year old without spending a fortune. I love how it has parental controls so I can limit his time playing. Used for reading and surfing the web, this tablet is great for all. Great screen clarity. Purchased the tablet because it was a very reasonable price. It has ended up being a good tablet. I bought this for my mom because she is too scared to even use her laptop. I thought this looked more user friendly since she knows my 5 year old nephew can use an iPad. I purchased several of these tablets during the holidays as gifts. Everyone absolutely loves the FireHD8, especially those with the prime memberships. My only regret is not purchasing one for myself. I bought this for husband for Christmas. He loves it. It fits his needs perfectly. I would recommend this product. Great product. Device performed as described. Great reviews. It\\'s easy to use and my son likes to play on it alot I bought this for my 86 year old father. he loves it. finds it very easy to use perfect gift perfect price for my wife to bring her into the technilogical modern world we live in Enjoying the kindle reading watching movies playing games Convenient and easy for my 10 year old to use to do homework on. We like it!! Would buy again.Still learning about it\\'s features. Good value Bought it for my 89 year old mom. She has enjoyed reading on it. Easy to use I needed to upgrade from the orginal Kindle fire and this Fire works great. Videos,games, email and battery life all are great. Works as expected. I enjoy reading newspaper articles, books, as well as banking apps and social media tools. I like this tablet. I had a nook, the fire has more memory, bigger screen and lower price. The downside? The Amazon Fire is so ridiculously proprietary that I cannot watch any of my movies on it from my nook. This is becoming industry standard. Too bad. I installed a driver for google play store; also I payed amazon to get rid of the lock screen ads ($15). It was worth it. I use this thing alot. Easy to use, great battery life, plenty of space and amazing screen quality. Excellent product. The screen is very easy to read and can access movies, books, and ,more. Was given as a gift to my mother and she loves it. This tablet was great. I bought it for my sister on christmas and she loves it. It is great for surfing the web and watching videos. The sound and screen quality are great and I like the blue light cutoff feature.I found that toggling back & forth online to be clumsy compared to a tablet.It is lightweight and easier to handle for long periods of time. The tablet is good for games like solitaire or other app games, and of course for books. But for internet or other applications, it would not be the top choice. Good buy for the money. My wife reads a ton, she uses it everyday. She\\'s owned others and this is by far the best. This tablet is hands down the best investment I\\'ve ever made. I used to carry a laptop to meetings, then my kids talked me into getting a tablet and what a difference. As long as there is wifi it does everything my laptop will. Hoping for an updated hdx kindle, but settled for this. Enjoy the expanded sd slot. very pleased with my amazon tablet. starting with the price ,ease of use, and size. Good cheap tablet. Great for Netflix and YouTube. Screen is a decent size just bigger than a phone and smaller than a laptop. It\\'s also HD which is a plus We love our tablets waiting recommend it to my friends Purchased to replace the one I bought for my brother in August (physical damage). This time, bought the extended warranty. No issues or claims so far! I think the amazon fire offer should include a stand/cover as standard. I enjoy mine a lot more since I was forced to purchase a stand/cover which holds the tablet. Would have preferred an instruction sheet to grt everything set up for use. Easy to access the apps, but not always easy to quit. The device works good, but since it\\'s the apps that make it what it is, more attention should be given to their operation. I was disappointed that it did not come with even a basic user\\'s guide. We are a total Apple family so I was a little hesitant to purchase this when our iPad stopped working. So glad we did because it\\'s perfect and can\\'t beat it for the price! Love using my new tablet (Amazon Fire). Easy to use. Great buy! Good value value for the money & easy to use. Bought this for my dad food Christmas and he loves it. This is a great option for a first tablet. It\\'s lightweight and user friendly. This is just an awesome tablet for the price and the features it has This little thing does everything and does it quickly. It could use a case, so think about getting one, but as an eReader it does everything it is supposed to. I so happy I can recommend this good thanks Best Buy is the number one I think I downloaded 6 new apps. I wait to surf the web. This thing is so slow to respond. My old refurbished iPad is better. I really only bought it to stream Hulu and Netflix. I\\'m not excited about lighting up the home screen to find advertisements every day, but I guess you get what you pay for. I wanted inexpensive, I got it! Don\\'t buy this if you are used to using quick responding electronics. My 10 year old uses it at school to scan qr codes and do his online math. Santa got this for my 7year old. Work\\'s great . He plays, games, gets on hulu, and can play his school education learning games. Now he doesn\\'t bother me to use my electronic devices . I have always been an iPad user but I love the kindle fire 8. It has everything you need and more and so much less expensive. Battery lasts a long time but I actually like my old Fire more. We got this for a young girl who is 9. She loves it and there a lot of Apps that she likes. There are parental controls which is a plus, recommend for almost any age group. I got everything I need for personal use. A great value for a cheap price. This was a perfect gift for my friend. Obsessed with reading and has been perfect for starting a greater library of books... Very easy to use and extremely affordable. Very happy with this purchase, and will buy more for family and friends! I love it for reading magazines and checking my email. This tablet is sturdy and great for my kids with games and learning. I love my kindle fire it holds a library of books that I can read anywhere. I change from my kindle fire to my phone if I don\\'t have the kindle with me. So I can start right where I am in the book and then finish up on my kindle fire when I can. I play games and listen to books all on this device. Love it It\\'s good for doing a number of basic tasks. The Amazon Underground feature is really cool. It feels like an Android but more limited. Great for reading e-mail, pictures or viewing internet. Great item, I can say it feel just like working with an iPad. Picture, sound, size and touch are very sweet. this is a great tablet for under $100 and you can add kodi on it, to me thats the best feature and the duel sided camera Got this as a gift for my Mom who reads a ton. She loves it for reading and great portability. Great tablet for the price. Great for media consumption. Screen seems sharp enough unless you get unbearably close to it. Wifi connectivity is good. Speakers sound poor but I didn\\'t expect any better from an 80$ tablet. Have had this tablet since November and is still going strong. Only complaint is the slow charging. but it isn\\'t too bad. This is a nice compact size, and is very user friendly! .Great resolution. Camera quality not so good tho. Gave it one less star for the camera. But overall its a great tablet I love it a lot and use it daily, bought books.... I got theses tablets for my grandkids for Christmas, they love them. My granddaughter loves her tablet. She has learned how to play both educational and recreational games. Will be very helpful in the future. Great tablet for the price easy set up and app and data transferring from the original Fire. My 5 yr old loves it, however we do experience some sound issues from time to time. This was purchased for my 9 year-old to play games, watch movies, and read on. When we set it up, I was extremely impressed with the quality that we got for the price! It\\'s processor is fast enough so that his games run smoothly. Setup was a breeze, and it\\'s very sturdy. This is a great lower price tablet for anyone looking to own a nice tablet for an extremely affordable price. Purchased for 4 yr old granddaughter who primarily uses for Netflix. Works great! the fire tablet is a nice size and is easy to use it is better then the 7in fire Not much to say here. Cheap, fast and very functional. I was able to install google play store and everything works perfectly. Best tablet in its category. If you want something better, you better be ready to pay 3-4 times the price. This tablet exceeded my expectations. Strong processor, nice screen. Wish it had Bluetooth and was not so centered around Amazon prime. Great item. My teen lives it. This item offers more than just reading. Tablet was college student. Replace a bulky laptop. Good for taking notes, reading text books and regular books. Loud alarm to wake college student for early classes. All a round got tool for school. its very easy to set up and use. love to take it with me . screen its large enough to read easy on it my 7\" wore out,my 8\" is much better,allthough the covers are expensive and screen protectors are hard to find. the battery life is exceptional ! Was looking for a tablet with expandable memory that was reliable. Amazon Tablet was the best choice Very easy to use. Size is just right --not cumbersome at all. Cannot beat the value and features that this product offers for the low price point. The Amazon-Fire is an inexpensive WiFi device we use for answering messages and is quickly shifted from person to person as well as moved from room to room. This tablet absolutely surprised me. The screen is awesome and the battery life is great. I love the Fire HD. Went back and bought the Fire 7\" for my wife that afternoon! I\\'ve had multiple Amazon Fire tablets. They are a great bargain. I love the ease of use and functionality. The only downfall is that it is really slow to charge. This was an awesome tablet purchased for my seven year old daughter for Christmas. Initially, I was looking to purchase the iPad mini but unfortunately they were sold out. This was my alternative and I am so glad I did. The price was perfect and the internet and app access have been great! She loves it! The only thing she misses is the FaceTime but it has not been a big deal at all! Gecksqd. Helpful in understanding different things . Upgrade from old Kindle Reader whose charger quit working android system easy to use I really like the value of this Fre. It is thin, light, and has all the features of those higher priced tablets. A good camera lens....and access to amazon deals make this well worth $69. Try it! Got this for my mom. Decent tablet not heavy and good pirce. She loves it. Great tablet - lag free when running apps... Good battery life. Only downside is lack of ability to screen mirror. Was available on older versions but no longer My father upgraded from the original Kindle Fire to this model, and he\\'s very happy with it. It doesn\\'t compete with more mainstream tablets, but he likes the Kindle\\'s system for downloading library books. Gave as Gift. the recipient powered down his IPad, and is giving it away. I bought this for my wife, this is her third Amazon Fire tablet. She mostly uses it for reading but she really likes the speed and the additional features on this one. She\\'s very happy with it Very bright display, speedy processor, and solid feel. Impressed. I bought this item as a Christmas gift for my granddaughter and she has loved every minute of it. It is intuitive, easy to use and she has it in her hands several times every day for everything from research for school to reading a book. Paw Paw hit a homer with this one! It was great product. the price which I got it was great. There\\'s different things my daughter can do,on it, plus I can read on it as well. It\\'s easy and intuitive. The only criticism is that it should be easier to go right into an application, instead of watching an advertisement, then having to figure out how to exit it Our first tablet. Purchased for my husband prior to a long train trip. Downloaded movies had Internet and was great for traveling. Works flawlessly. Good contender to my brother\\'s iPad. Much cheaper in price. Win for me. I purchased this for my mom for Christmas and she loves it! The amazon kindle is nice, portable and very easy to use. I bought this as a Christmas gift for my 8 year old. I was a big hit. I love the 8\" screen. The price was perfect for my budget. Great price for the internal memory size. If you are looking for a good tablet, this is it! I bought this for my 8 year old. I was a great buy. The price was affordable compared to other tablets on the market and e 8\" screen is perfect. Another great buy!!! I have an original Kindle Fire and am really enjoying my new updated version. Larger screen and very easy to navigate. I was given a fire when I was recuperating from spine surgery a few years ago. I used it for everything for quite some time. This one has a camera and plays all the latest files. I still have and use the old one as well. An excellent content delivery system. I got it with Best Buy customer appreciation money...what a deal! We purchased this as a gift. Researching and word of mouth led us to purchase this one. Very user friendly. The UI experience is great, especially for Prime members. The tablet is quick and responsive with plenty of memory to ha for any task. bought this for my elderly mother to play games, get email and pics via Instagram, etc. now she\\'s a geek! easy to use, even for a novice and very reasonably priced. Great buy, highly recommend this. Purchased this as a Christmas gift for my girlfriend. She absolutely loves it and uses it every day. She\\'s very picky about electronics and she loves her tablet so it must be good! It was a gift. The individual thoroughly enjoys it. the kindle is a great tool especially for the money. Fast processing, great screen clarity. Highly recommended This is my third Kindle (second Fire). I use it constantly primarily for reading electronic books. Currently have over 350 books in Kindle library. Like it best when traveling as I don\\'t have to carry a bunch of hardback books with me. Anywhere I go where I know there will be a waiting line (haircut, doctor\\'s or dentist\\'s office) I have it with me and use it productively to read.. The Fire HD is a nice tablet that functions well but doesn\\'t meet the shear horsepower and feel of an iPad....but, at about 1/4 the cost, it fits the bill pretty well. Great price. Easy start up easy to use.. large memory Great product I love that I can read all my books on here and search the internet! Being able to sign in and not have to do any setting up makes this device super user friendly! Love the tablets. Light, Good battery life, and fast performance. It was a fast deliver, the tablets is awsomo and it\\'s a great service My 15 year old is curious about adult material. But with this tablet you can control so much of the content he sees. You can even control how much he learns before watching videos and games. The Kindle/Amazon Fire HD Tablet is not a high priced item but it is everything I want from a tablet. Easy to use, easy to read and easy to pay for. A great tablet Best tablet hands down. Bigger screen and great new features. Has Alexis also. Lots of storage as well. I love this tablet. The size fits perfectly in one hand. The display is wonderful and the loaded apps have me reading again. It is the absolute best! Small and compact, surprisingly good image and sound. Having family members who lose cables all the time, this is a great deal. Reliable cable for the iphone at an affordable price. Plus the various cable colors allow me to assign colors for a person or charging station so we know when someone \"barrows\" a cable. I am satisfied with my products. I look weekly for a good deal. I look forward to more deals With a little tweaking you can install Playstore without rooting. It\\'s a great tablet, excellent color, fast, and battery lasts a very long time. Bought this table for my 4 and 9 year old for Christmas. They love them! It is a reliable easy to use tablet. Holds charge well and provides for my needs. I bought this for my girlfriend as a Christmas Present. She is a avid reader and has been using our ipad to read online library books. She asked me for a nook reader, but after seeing the fire....it was a no brainer to go in that direction. it is used everyday and she loves it. My grandson love this tablet alot of great games and learning activities. This smokes the Fire 7 which I picked up last year. Powerful and great screen for streaming...cannot go wrong for the price. Bought for my 7 yr old. Quality product at an affordable price. Bought on sale for $69.99. I would recommend this anytime as it\\'s a great product it\\'s For the money the Kindle Fire is the best tablet on the market. I wish I didn\\'t buy my I pad already I would have got one of these for myself. this does everything and more the older, more expensive Kindles. I\\'m not sure I need my ipad or laptop any more. My son loves it. There are a lot of kid friendly apps available. Purchased this for my 83 year old mother to primarily use as an e-reader. It seems as this may be easier for her to see than an actual book. She does not always find new technology easy to use, but seems to be doing ok with this tablet. She also is using it to play solitaire and possibly some other games. I left my 7 on airline flight and bought the 8 to replace love love the speed and the video on it. Glad I bought it is worth it!!!! the download speed has improved very much!! I was surprised on how easy it was to use. I bought it for my mother and she totally loves it, and I do too! Oh my, oh my, oh my! Amazon can do no wrong! This device is my precious! Purchased this for my wife during Christmas and got a great deal on it. Compared to the older version that she has this model is faster, brighter, and more convenient with Alexa. I would recommend this product looking for a tablet with lots of features packed in it. Purchased the device for my neice, she loves it, highly recommend Price/Quilty this thing is a no brainer. Awesome portal into the Amazon world. My wife uses this for playing on line games. She loves it I thought about purchasing a Samsung tablet also, however I do like to read as well. I saw several reviews that have a negative view because of the Amazon software and that it is not stock Android.However, I have installed the Play Store (you can find instructions online) and I am very happy with this tablet. I would definitely recommend it. Also I have had 10\" tablets before, and this one is just the right size. Bought this to update the old one we have and so far it\\'s been a good buy. Great screen resolution and easy to use. Battery life is really good. This was the perfect tablet for my wife for Christmas, she loves it. Easy to navigate and plenty of room for her favorites! Size, brightness, and convenience are good. The option to link with android products for messages is a little hard. I bought this for Christmas and my 10 year old loves it!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I need a tablet to begin exploring google and kindle fire was a great choice. Got this tablet for my mom who isn\\'t very tech savvy. She loves it. Can\\'t beat the price I am very impressed with this tablet. It is faster than some iPads I have used. I gave this as a gift and my Mother-in-law loves it. Thank you Hands down a great update to my first gen Kindle. Worthwhile! Cheaper than the paper white and has more abilities I bought this to replace an older model and am very happy with the product. Mostly used for reading but also for surfing the web, facebook, etc. Love it!! Got this as a gift for my mother and she\\'s satisfied This was a gift for my wife and she loves it!! It is much better than the old one Bought for my daughter instead of an I-pad. Works well, love the Amazon Underground App Store, but battery life doesn\\'t seem to last as long as older I-pads. Easy enough though for a child to use. Got it on sale and it\\'s good for what you pay for instead of paying a lot of money on an iPad. this electronic book reader is great, able to read ebooks, watch movies, play games. or browse the internet. it lets you hookup to any internet connection you want to use as long as its range Does a good job of performing basic functions and provides a good amount of entertainment. Good for watching movies or playing simple games or performing simple tasks. Looks good. Seems like it is well made and of good quality materials. Have not had any problems. Battery life is great for the price. Amazon sells a quality product. I am happy to get this product and i would also recommend this to my friends Last got Fire 7\" for my kids, with an Amazon Freetime subscription. These are very good for the price with two flaws: The screen is good and much better than other Android devices at 7\" but not great, and got the 8 Mb version with I would not recommend in hindsight. Because Android\\'s sub-par management on SD cards, got these this year. It has a much better screen, not only larger but with better resolution, adequate speakers for its price, it\\'s fast enough and overall more enjoyable to use. 16 Gb is the minimum I\\'d recommend, even with SD cards because some apps just work better with internal storage, and some apps even stored in SD will still use some amount of internal storage.It also has Alexa voice support.The main reason for these tablets in my case is the Freetime subscription that has unlimited access to thousands of age-appropriate books, hundreds (or thousand) of free apps and heavily curved web access per age presets. Amazon Fire OS has a decent support for multi-user and in particular kids accounts. My kids are 7 and 9. They spend a lot of time on games as expected but also read a good amount of books. As far as functionality it works well. I can surf the internet, match movies, check social media, and anything else a tablet is supposed to do. The app store has a good variety off apps. It does not have as many as the iTunes store, but there is plenty of variety. The reason I knock a star off is the constant ads. I know that this is an Amazon product, but the ads get a little annoying. I DON\\'T USE MUCH OF THE APPLICATIONS BUT IT WORKS FOR THINGS I NEED. If your looking for a great tablet without the high price this is the tablet for you... My wife loves her new Fire 8 tablet. It is easy to use and rubs quickly and smoothly,. Bright screen, lightweight, great price, I love it! It is a very nice tablet, but the 10 inch tablet seems faster and easier to enjoy for the price Really wanted a tablet that was near the nexus 7, but didn\\'t have too much bulk! I looked at the Nvidia Shield as well, and ended up settling on the Fire HD. Tremendous resolution, great battery life, and very easy to use. Highly recommend to anyone that wants a portable tablet for reading, watching videos/movies, and gaming. The first tablet I bought was good at first until it stops charging. I went to best buy to check it and they said that everything is okay. We tried it again at home and it was the same thing, it charged for a few min until probably 2% and will stop. I brought it back to the store and they replace it with a new one. So far I don\\'t have problem with it as well as the other 2 tablets that I bought together with the first tablet. It\\'s alright to browse the Internet and watch videos. Works great and has an excellent screen size. You cannot go wrong for the price unless you need to install google apps. Amazon blocks them although I have heard there are work arounds. Great product, good speed, nice resolution for the price. I have only had this Amazon Fire Hd8 since December 6, 2016 and it has already quit charging. It was easy to set up and use and the screen is big enough to play games on Its a nice tablet however it could be better but you get what you pay for My grandbabie love their kindles this is the 8th Kindle I buy for them I bought this for my son as a first tablet. I am impressed by the built-in parental app. It has a good level of control that I feel comfortable with. My son likes his Kindle. I think he will like it more when he gets used to having to get through the \"educational\" features before he can play. I admittedly need to explore the tablet more myself. That will enable me to customize the settings and the apps for him and myself. First experience with a tablet for my husband who likes it and uses it all the time. We like it. I bought this for my niece for a Christmas gift.she is 9 years old and she love it. My old Kindle was not working so good anymore so bought this one on a Black Friday Deal from Best Buy. Price was great. The only problem I had was that at times it did not seem to be charging well or fast. I took it back to Best Buy and they would have replaced it for me but then would have lost all progress in games I had played. The person at Tech Support suggested that I change the plug in \"brick\". He said that they have had problems with that. I can use the same plug that I use for my iphone and now it charges fine. Glad that it was an easy fix. Love the 8 inch HD tablet. Great colors on screen. Not cheaply built like some. This is the best tablet you can get for under $100. I have used or own many tablets including Ipad Pro/Mini, Samsung Galaxy Tab and Nexus. They are popular high-end tablets but easily cost over $300 or $400. I was very surprised by quality of this tablet and it gives you much more than what you pay. Battery performance is great- it easily lasts over 10 hours after charge. Speakers are solid with two drivers. Performance is decent although not as fast/responsive as high-end tablets. I was bit disappointed at its low contrast display. However for its price, I cannot complain too much. I purchased two of these tablets as a gift for Christmas. It has an exceptional HD screen which provides rich colors and makes it easy for those that like to read book, articles etc. One of the best tablets. Good for watching YouTube and reading as well. This Kindle is the right size for travel, yet large enough to read. Love all the features and price! Kindle Fire HD8 is great! Love the the size and the graphics. Easy to use and navigate. Perfect gift for mom! The battery life is great.Last on a bus trip to kept he quiet. I got this for my wife and she loves it. Great speed and display Gift for our son and he is really enjoying it. He can read as well as play games. I use this tablet as an e-reader and to listen to prime music at the same time. Great for this.Still leaning other features. I got this mainly to watch tv/movies. Battery life is best of all devices I have used to date. Enjoyed the Kindle 7 and now this better version as well. Purchased this on sale for my son. He and I use the tablet to watch movies, play games, read books, and browse the Internet. It\\'s great for the price we paid. If you\\'re a fan of Amazon, you automatically have apps for their services.The downside is you are not able to use google apps and the adds that appear from Amazon when you turn the device on. Really a nice item ..works wonderfully ..for the cost it\\'s a bargain Great product for the price! Works great and comes with ample storage. My kids really like this and if your buying a tablet for kids it\\'s worth it, but maybe not so great for adults. this tablet is excellent i use it on the couch inthe bedroom and in the car too i simplty love it Great resolution, easy to use. Amazon Prime gives you free movies, books, and games! This tablet was a Christmas gift for my dad. It has great resolution and is easy to use. With Amazon prime you get free movies, books, and games. I would highly recommend. We bought this tablet for our 4 year old to play games and watch Netflix. He loves it and at this price point, we\\'re not overly concerned if he damages it. We bought a nice foam case that keeps it well protected. We\\'re highly satisfied. Very good picture and it even takes pictures which is awwsome. You even get a free month of Amazon prime which came in very handy around Christmas Time My daughter loves this tablet! She plays multiple games and has taken video. Easy to use and the color is very vivid! Screen size good for older people. Great resolution and easy to use. Seems to work well. Screen quality is good. Like the size. I had been thinking about getting a reader for a while but did not know which one I wanted. As I looked at and tried several, I thought the Kindal Fire was the one I wanted. After discussing the features of the product with a salesperson, I decided.that it was the reader I wanted. It has turned out to be just what I wanted. Great value for the money. However, the operating system is a bit clunky. Constant notifications and messages to delete. Some can be turned off, other seem to just keep appearing. The reader app surprisingly is less than intuitive. I bought this for my son after he broke his iPad, and I am so glad I did!! It has unlimited games and books, which has made such a huge difference in his desire to read!! Love love this tablet!!! Bought this during black friday for $60. while I\\'m skeptical at first, it turns out to be a solid tablet for everyday use. Not to mentioned the great low price! I love the size of this tablet. I have an Ipad and think I prefer this size. It\\'s easy to carry and a great size for reading. Got it for Christmas and am loving it! I haven\\'t tried to take any pictures yet and I didn\\'t really purchase it for taking photos. I saw the reviews before purchasing and they were not good regarding photo quality. Again, that was not my purpose so am not too concerned at this time. The size and price makes this a best buy! I\\'m very pleased with my tablet I am thrilled with this purchase! Both affordable and high quality! I will try again for the 3rd time with my new Amazon Fire. It seems to have nice upgrades. This tablet works as well or better than my iPad. It is quicker and simpler to use with better speed and reaction. Pros:Great value for moneyEnough power to handle lot of Android gamesDecent battery lifeCons:Feels slow after using for a few weeksLow-resolution screen and camera. This is almost as good as my iPad mini. i love my apple iPad however this is a great backup. Tablet is great does everythimg as it should. Great entry level tablet This game seems to be another good addition to the Pokemon craze. My son got this for Christmas and has played it often since. He says that it\\'s \"awesome\", which is high praise indeed. So much better than my previous kindle, I\\'ve used my new kindle daily and I\\'m not much of a tech person. It is light weight and easy to navigate. The battery holds a good charge as well I was looking to purchase a tablet for my kids so they could work on homework. This is just what they need in terms of capability and size. It is a great tablet for the price. The 8 inch Fire is s great reader, 5 star. The only down side are limited add on applications. This tablet is so easy to set up and use. Very intuitive! Love love this device and all of my books can be transferred from my old version! Awesome The reader was easy to setup for a novice reader and email user. 2nd kindle bought as a gift. Easy to operate, can fit in my purse and eliminates having to carry around multiple traditional books. I gave this to my 6-year old for Christmas and it has been the perfect gift. Great price point (compared to an ipad) that can function for exactly what she needs. Screen is good . Lack of Google play kinda hurts but you will survive. The issue of back buttons or multifunction buttons is that sometime they don\\'t appear when you need them.. as they are part of the screen . So you have to kinda summons them which is a pain It\\'s a good tablet for the value. Downside is there\\'s no Google Play Store access. So you\\'re limited to apps in the Amazon app store. This is my first Android tablet. I have used numerous Apple iPad\\'s though.The only thing I have been dissatisfied with is that there isn\\'t an Instagram app available but that doesn\\'t have anything to do with Amazon or Kindle. Got one for myself and one for my son. Like the parental settings available. No more inappropriate youtube videos. Fast, great screen and appreciate the blue light setting especially at night. I purchased the HD 8 to use as a viewer for my Pearl RearVision camera, which requires dual band Wi-Fi and Blue tooth. I installed the programs & got everything up and working beautifully. However I was so impressed with its features, performance, and ease of use, that I\\'ve added a 128 gb MicroSD card so I can download Amazon videos for my grand kids to watch while we are on the road. The price was terrific as well, but comes with the cost of \"free\" ads when the you turn on the tablet. (FYI the tablet mounts magnetically to the vent holder and is removed when not in use.) If you are looking for an entry level tablet, this is it.The Kindle fire HD is perfect for kids! My daughter gets great use with this tablet. She loves to read so she gets best of both worlds. She can get her books and surf the web. Fsntastic buy Excellent value for my 3 yr old, everything you need plus HD and the wife can order off amazon prime, so happy wife and kid for the price cant beat it, 2nd one I have owned.... The Amazon HD 8 is by far the best budget tablet. If you just need a tablet to browse the web and watch videos this tablet is the way to go! That being said, it is fairly slow but who cares if you do not use the tablet for photo/video editing, gaming, picture taking, etc... I bought this for my mom. She loves the convince of reading her books on there This product is easy to use and take along with you I previously owned the Fire HD 7 and was excited about the HD 8. After getting the HD 8 and using it I started to notice how they were able to cut costs. The screen was not as crisp, the processor was slower and the speakers were not as loud as previous versions. Overall a good buy for the price but if you are expecting the quality that went into previous versions look elsewhere. Great for taking on trips. 16 GB, camera, computer The Amazon Fire HD8 is a great buy, very inexpensive but delivers great quality. Give a 4 rating and not 5 because there are advertisements on lock screen. Some may welcome the ads others not. Overall this tablet is great. Battery life is several days with very minimal usage. Battery lasts 7 to 12 hours with average usage including video. This Fire tablet is overall a good size, and has great features! We got this for our 9 yr old daughter and its perfect for her. There hasn\\'t been any issue with the games and educational apps she uses. I was in the middle of moving and didnt want to get a new labtop and found this Amazon Fire for a good price. Ive been very happy with it. If your looking for a cheap easy to use tablet look no further. This is a very good product my kids do homework on it Bought this for our 6 year old daughter and she uses it daily. She enjoys watching movies on it and playing learning games. So far it has been very durable and battery life has been great. Bought this for my husband at Christmas. He is VERY happy with it and It keeps him out of my hair. Bought one for our young son too. Now i can breathe. LOL. We\\'ve had no issues with them and has more than met our expectations. Well worth the money & a VERY good deal! Nice tablet, great price for the product makes a good gift for someone. My son wanted a tablet just for his books. We looked at e-readers and tablets, this was so much better and the price was perfect. I\\'m used to a n iPad so I wasnt impressed with the kindle. I found it hard to navigate the fire hd is great for reading kindle books . Its pretty slow for surfing the web. If your looking for a great kindle this is it. I would not recommend this for surfing the web. Bought this kindle for my dad for Christmas. He loves it. Best budget tablet out there. Hasn\\'t everything you need for someone who uses a tablet here and there. The only regret I have is that the price went down the week after I purchased it. It is much easier to use than a phone because of it\\'s screen size and it\\'s capabilities. This tablet is replacing an older model and the updates are wonderful. I can handle most media on this tablet and the resolution is great. I like the change of the camera to the back of the kindle instead of the front screen; now I can see what I\\'m aiming at! Easy to use and can\\'t beat the price. Love the kindle and the price was excellent. I would recommend it. Bought 2 of these tablets for my kids. They love them and easy to use. Bought this for my son and he absolutely loves it! I chose this one because of the price and size of screen to use as an ereader. It has not disappointed. Got this for the kids for Xmas...was the BEST gift. This is a great tablet for anyone easy to use!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Amazon Fire HD 8 Tablet: With a vivid 8 touch screen and access to Amazon Underground, this tablet makes it easy to watch movies, play games or catch up on your reading with personalized recommendations. Cloud storage offers simple access to your content from anywhere. Great entry level tablet/reader holds a lot and it\\'s expandable of 128 GB With the Amazon fire tablet you get everything you would expect in a high-end tablet for less than $100. That\\'s hard to beat! Love this tablet daughter uses it mainly and she really likes it good for reading and games as well as web surfing meets all needs ! Our 11 year old daughter received this for Christmas and she seems to love it so fay. Does just enough to keep her entertained and I love the fact that she can easily access her books when she wants. I loved this tablet. I did! BUT I did not love that I was being sold ads every time I powered up! I loathe even more that I would have had to pay $15 to discontinue that feature. Amazon if you want $105 dollars for the Kindle Fire, charge it! but don\\'t under price the device, and then flash ads at the the consumer at every opportunity. It is unbecoming of you! I returned this item pronto! This isn\\'t a high end tablet. Don\\'t buy it if your goal is to play the latest high octane tablet games. But for general use, for most people - web surfing, light games like Angry Birds and those match the fruit games, casting movies to a television - it\\'s an amazing value. The Amazon geared operating system isn\\'t a problem. It took a few minutes to get the Google world onto the tablet. - Google Play, Google Store, Google this and that. The 7\" version is an even better deal, but my mom needed this slightly larger screen. She loves it! Bought this for my father in law who is not tech savvy. The free \"May Day\" feature is the best part- I don\\'t get called for tech support all of the time. I\\'ve had this tablet for a few months now and i like it. The picture is excellent, the sound from the speakers is more than sufficient and the wifi is quick. bought this for my father, who never did much on computers and was not sure he would actually use this. He unwrapped it, asked for some games to be downloaded and hasn\\'t looked back! He has used the internet as well as the game apps and couldn\\'t be happier. Got this when they were on sale last year and love it!I use it primarily to read and get emails with some surfing. It has worked flawlessly for these applications. Nice tab and worth for its money..got this from best buy during thanks giving and gifted to my friend... Hard to use, No way to delete things from screen. Need better manual. most books are impossible if they are reference books. Bought for our son so he wouldn\\'t have to carry books back from his deployment Sweet tablet yo, does good work for my grandma and super easy I bought this tablet on Black Friday, when it was on special for my little girl. I wasn\\'t expecting much from the tablet... boy was I surprised by its capabilities! Love the tablet! Bought for my 9 years Granddaughter, she loves it. I love my new Kindle. Use it everyday. It is easy to use and understand I chose this a tablet. Very easy to use and navigate. My 6 and 4 year old grandsons can use them with ease. Some apps are limited as you do not have Google Play, but there is plenty of games and learning games available. Got this for my 10 year old grandson. He really likes it a lot. This is good for kids to learn responsibility using tablets. This was an item I bought for black Friday because the price was really low. I love it. It gets the job done, great travel item. $49.99, is exactly how much it\\'s worth. The sound is low, but again for a good inexpensive, travel tablet, this is a Best Buy:) Long battery life, good screen, reasonably fast.gaming. Got it for my 9 year old son for his Common robot, he loves it, it\\'s very easy to use and for the price well worth it I bought 2 one for each one of my daughters and they both like them. Got this kindle as a Christmas present for my mother and she absolutely loved it. She enjoys reading at night but hates how dim the lights are when she reads a book. This was a perfect compromise! This is a very good tablet for the price, especially for Amazon Prime members. The display is very sharp and so far the battery life is excellent! Great starter tablet without the big cost. Does everything I need. Got this for my wife for Christmas, wasn\\'t sure she would use it. Turned out to be a great gift. Perfect for email, facebook with the Kids, get\\'s her bookclub book delivered instantly from Amazon. And good battery life with a sharp picture. I bought 2 of these. I didn\\'t want to pay the price for an iPad since they were a gift for my pre-teens. Very satisfied with my purchase and the kids were able to get their gaming apps. Con: they take a while to charge, that\\'s why I\\'m giving it 4 stars. The Amazon Fire is great for our 6 year old to play some games. Brought it as a gift for my wife and she loves it! I was initially excited to get the Kindle. I am extremely disappointed with all the ads. Even more disappointed to find out that I could pay Amazon more money to remove the ads. It\\'s frustrating that Best Buy and more specifically Amazon, don\\'t let the consumer know on the box or in store advertising that what you\\'re buying is a mini advertising billboard. Why couldn\\'t there be an upfront statement on the box or in the store stating that the \"low price\" is subsidized by all the ads on the device? Would this have changed my purchase? Absolutely!!!! I would have spent a couple bucks more and probably got a Samsung tablet. Kindle Fire HD8 is an upgrade for me from Kindle Fire 7. It has many more features and is very easy to navigate. Can\\'t beat the quality and performance of this tablet for $60. I bought it to be my main link with my Amazon Prime. But used it last week instead to download Direct TV app so I could use it to watch the FBS championship game. It worked great but it couldn\\'t help my bama team win. Just what my Niece wanted for Christmas! She is enjoying every minutes use ! Bought for my Grandson for Christmas. He loves it. Glad I went with the 16GB,Thanks to the advice of BEST Buy employee. I got this for reading books, I still like ipad better though. Purchased this for our 8yo--she loves it! Had to return the 1st one after just.a few days as the screen would go black after typing in password--periodically. However, Best Buy traded it out for a new one! BOUGHT THIS FOR MY FATHER AS HE HAD MY OLD KINDLE EASY FOR HIM TO USE This is my 4th Kindle - I use it as a tablet when I travel Overall this is a great product. It sometimes freezes with some of the games but other apps work great. Alexa is a great addition. So many apps to look at hard to put down when everythig can be reached at your figertips Great tablet, sturdy, excellent screen quality. Amazon has done a fantastic job of making their tablets user friendly. Excellent for reading books or playing games. Would highly recommend. The screen is great on the Fire HD 8. This tablet was given to a child and she loves the tablet. The only thing I don\\'t like about the whole Amazon experience is the advertisement. Other than that, the tablet is nice. The headphone jack restarts the tablet when you plug the headphone cord into it. That is why I am giving the product only 2 stars. Otherwise, the screen is great. Simple and objective this tablet is an excellent choice for adults and children. This is an intermediate size tablet that works very well for its designed purpose. The price was good and it has plenty of acc. Love this one.It is my third kindle.My last one was a bit larger but it was a bit heavy.Love this one for reading or playing games.I can check my email and shop on line as well as take and store photos.I can also listen to music. Good tablet. A lot of tablet for the money. Great for kids Amazon continues to offer quality products with the Amazon fire HD 8 for a reasonable price. Good price, easy to work and the Grandkids loved . Wanted something small and this was perfect size . They just keep getting better. This is great for the beginner or pro I only use the kindle fire tablet for entertainment; music, games and eBooks. It\\'s a great basic tablet at a low price. The SD card I added allows me to save lots music and books. The tablet is rather slow in charging but once fully charged it holds up well. Upgraded from 1st generation Fire tablet. Decided to go with 16GB tablet and there were none in store so I had to order for free delivery to store. Arrived on day promised. Was easy to sync new tablet with older tablet. Very nice picture and video. Great value. Wife loves it so makes my life better what else do you need to know past that. The screen size is good and the HD pictures are clear. I also like the camera photos. They are better than my cell phone camera. The size of the pictures are great. I would recommend this Fire HD for the ease of use. The built quality is great taking into considerarions its price. The tablet is pretty fast and responsive. However, Amazon\\'s operating system is horrible. I miss a lot of apps that I use in my Apple devices, and some others that just don\\'t work as good such as Mint and Netflix (don\\'t have download capability). Also it won\\'t work with my Chromecast devices... I bought this for my wife and she absolutely loves this device . I have an older kindle and wanted more space. This works very well The amazon fire hd8 is awesome! Easy to navigate, color is beautiful A great tablet for not a lot of money. Does what the more expensive tablets does for less. Got it last black Friday. Was looking for a cheap decent tab. Could\\'ve been better if there was a mirroring capability. Was looking at some more expensive Android tablets to replace a 3-year old device and saw this one on sale. Despite the relatively much lower price, I was originally very worried that the Amazon app ecosystem was going to be sorely lacking compared to the full Google Play catalog. But it turns out that while it is missing some important apps (not just games but productivity apps too), the more than adequate specs (good enough screen, 1.5 GB of RAM, decent processor) are enough for 95% of what I need from a tablet. And if you can get it on sale, you can\\'t go wrong. Lastly, if you\\'re deciding between the 7\" and this 8\" Fire, splurge a little bit and get this one instead. Amazon Fire HD8 is great for browsing and reading. GPS system not that great though. I was not told I had to belong to Amazon. Could not get it to work with my Router. I had been wanting this Tablet for some time and finally decided to purchase it. I am heart sick to have to return it. At one time working with the a general Manager by the name of Brenda on my problems, she was highly disrespectful , embarrassing to me I front of other customers and very rude. Representing Best Buy to the people who actually pay her salary and taking all into account, I would fire her in a heart beat. I understand from other employees she is like this quite often. If you can\\'t fire her maybe taking her off the floor where she has to deal with the public and putting her behind the scenes would benefit Best Buy more than you know. 01-16-2017. Thank you. This is the best thing for reading specially on the go. Now I want one. My older son wants one to. Keep of the good work. It\\'s good budget tablet for someone who wants to use light apps, video streaming, and internet.1.5gb ram is enough for most apps.16g memory and sd card slot gives enough space. This is my second amazon fire purchase. I wanted one for home and one to keep with me for traveling and work. It\\'s was to negotiate and fits all my basic daily needs. Bought this tablet cause it was super cheap during December. It\\'s a good tablet for someone who doesn\\'t need a powerhouse This is a good tablet for basic use. I ened up returning it and going with an iPad which met my needs more. This tablet would be good for someone with limited computer knowledge/use. Purchased this as a Christmas gift for an adopted family. The teenager absolutely loved it! Awesome tablet! Super quick, great picture, and overall great quality This was bought as a replacement for my wife\\'s previous kindle. She is loving the larger screen and the fact that it has a camera. Nice tablet, gives different choices for readers. Easy to use. Bought the tablet on Black Friday to replace a 4 year old Nexus 7. Liked it so much that I purchased another a week later at full price. Bright clear screen, good battery life, expandable memory, fast and easy to use. No complaints. Bought it for myself. It is everything its advertised to be. Works great; especially if you are a Amazon Prime member. This product met my needs perfectly. It was easy to set up and portable to use anywhere. I bought this tablet during black friday for 60 dollars and it is well worth the price. Definitely an upgrade from the first gen tablet. This watch is not only very useful, it\\'s very cute and comfortable. I love the fitness aspects-it motivates me to be more active. I also enjoy the \"smartwatch\" abilities. I can read my text messages without anyone knowing it! Also, the battery last a few days at the very least. Best Buy has a good price structure for the Kindle Staff members were very helpful Had a paperwhite for years...The fire is my go to for news, new shows, and reading. Good book prices, credible news. Loving it. Paying $49 for a decent screen size to support portable surfing and email on wifi is a great deal. Not sure I\\'m a fan of Silk, but it works well enough. The Amazon Fire HD is easy to use. The 8\" tablet is just the right size. Sharp screen that\\'s not too big or small. Takes some getting used to if you normally use an IPhone. Be prepared for ads, which must be the reason they can sell it at such a low price. Slim profile, just heavy enough to feel substantial and high quality. Hard to find cases at physical stores. My friend is enjoying getting acquainted with her first ever electronic device. It is just what she needed to get into the digital age. She is an older woman and is excited about all she can do on her Kindlefire. I was not sure what to expect from this little tablet at such a low price but I am impressed! The 8 inch version is a good size and a lot easier to carry around than my heavier 10 inch tablet. I read negative reviews about the video quality but I have not had any issues and use it to watch Netflix regularly with very clear and uninterrupted quality. The amazon App Store is definitely limited but with an android based system, it is very easy to install the google play store without having to root your device and voiding the warranty. This was a gift for my wife and she has truly enjoyed it. The different lighting for reading so helpful. Very user friendly. For the price best deal out there. Bought it for my wife who reads a lot of books. She loves it!! This is a very solid device for under $100. The screen quality is great, and performance is hard to beat for most typical use. I needed more power to run some very intense apps, like Litchi for controlling a DJI Mavic. So if you are looking for a Powerhouse you should look for something with a bit more processor and atleast 3Gb Ram. Amazon is great tablet and the price is excellent great Have a 7\", wanted a bigger screen. This is perfect and price was great. User friendly and overall great product. Camera quality is not the greatest but this is not intended to be used as a camera so I can\\'t complain. Love this tablet easy to use and extremely affordable If you\\'re main purpose is shows, books, light web browsing/social media, and light gaming -- this is the perfect tablet. Very friendly price. Nice construction. Bought as a reading tool for my daughter. She enjoys it and also the fact that she can download apps. Great tool for school and fun Bought for husband to replace his old one. Uses it all the time and would recommend. daughter loves it uses it every day likes everything about it. My youngest daughter is very pleased with this tablet. Easy to use. Perfect for using for my clinicals in nursing school Great tablet for the price, it was a Christmas present and so far so good! Easy to use and the HD is awesome. The simplicity as well as the easy to follow directions to set it up is great. It does everything I want it to do. Great products as usual and great customer service Very functional for a tablet and e-reader. This was a purchase for my stepmom who broke her previous Kindle. She likes it because the screen is big, ease of use, and you can access the internet. The kids side is good too for the kids but some of the apps like YouTube and YouTube Kids will not play on this because it\\'s an Amazon operating system. Overall I would recommend this to people who like the regular e-readers and want a tablet. It helps if your an amazon prime member . You can download a lot more things to do on the tablet This was purchased as a gift for an avid reader and as a streaming media device. I looked at the bigger kindle but this one is the right compromise between size and portability for the planned uses. A great alternative to the more expensive tablets. Battery lasts for quite a while. Love love love my kindle fire. Had the original and then bought and iPad then bought this kindle and I am wondering why I even bought the iPad. Will not switch again. I will stick with my kindle. The fire runs well and was easy to set up. The pop up adds are a bit annoying but the tablet works well. Happy with the purcase. Gift for my mother in law. ok i did like the product very much thank you for ok I recommend this tablet !!! I like it a lot , perfect size and perfect price Great for reading books. Does everything an iPad or tablet does. Bought for Xmass for my wife. She is not electronic competent, but found is easy to use. Tends to flip out of my screen to something else. Each screen change = at least one pop up ad. Otherwise, it\\'s been reliable so far. It is a lot cheaper than other tablets with all the functions I need. This is a excellent tablet for browsing the internet and reading ebooks and for the price you can\\'t beat it.. My ND would way rather have a fire any day than an ipad! Loved the product. First I was disappointed that I could not download Google Store apps but a Quick Google Search fixed that Issue and now I can download any Google Store Apps. The Battery Life is amazing as I was able to Watch around 4 Full Movies on a Single Charge. Performance is great as Games like Marvel Champions Modern Strike Online had no issues. Able to add an SD Card is just perfect as I dont have to worry about Storage for downloading Movies or Apps. Speakers are better then my Samsung Galaxy S7. For the Price point of this Tablet there is not a single thing to Complain. If I have to Brightness of the Screen can be better. the amount i paid for the tablet is worth it on sale. Gifted this to my Mom primarily for reading books. Able to check out e-books from our local library. Works great. She also uses this for Skype, e-mails and Facebook. Her grand kids also use it - downloaded few games and play. Bought this during Black Friday sale and was an even better deal. It is a good tablet. My grandson loves it . He was very happy with it . This tablet works well for surfing the internet and playing music. My husband and I have totally enjoyed owning these Amazon Fire tablets. They are so much easier on the eyes than our iphones! My 8-year-old grandson is able to access all the games he\\'s used to, but also many new games and videos. He finds something new to do almost every time he turns it on. Great improvement over the old kindle fire. Better size than the hd7. Not to big and not too small. Fast processing spead. My wife loves it. Great picture quality and easy to use should have bought 2 at the sale price, fast, decent graphics great for reading ebooks best of fits in wife\\'s purse If you are looking for an inexpensive tablet just for basic web surfing/shopping/etc., I don\\'t know that you can get a better deal. However, that is about all you can do. We found out the hard way that the Fire (which we bought to replace a misplaced iPad, so maybe we were just spoiled) is pretty limited in terms of the Apps you can download. Forget about any Google based Apps and many of the standard apps that are generally available in the Android or Apple market place. I love Amazon itself and don\\'t have any major issues with the product I got for the price I paid, I just won\\'t be going the cheap route in the future. Hindsight being 20/20, I should have spent the money to just get a new iPad since that is what we were used to. Got this for my 10 year old son. Great for reading books and playing games. Can\\'t beat the price. Bought for my wife.. she loves it.. took some getting use to though but she is doing well with it I have a couple of iPads and decided to get this for general browsing, movie watching etc. Very pleased with the overall package. An added bonus is the very nice Amazon integration. Bought as a gift for my mother. Instead of her feeling locked at the computer she can now access the web from anywhere in the house. This is just the perfect item for what we needed. It is compact and can go anywhere with you. She says this was the best gift she ever received. My kids got this to replace their Ipads and haven\\'t missed a beat. Love the new Fire - great for books, games, and getting online! Easy to use features and perfect size screen to take on the go! Bought this for my aunt for Christmas. She had wanted a book reader. But then she decided she wanted something she could \"play games on.\" She\\'s very happy with it! Never owned a tablet before, but am loving it so far. great tablet, simple to use, just love it.compatible with other amazon products. I bought this for my Mother because her Nook wasn\\'t working any more. Although it took her a little while to adjust to the new device, she really enjoys it! I wanted a tablet that was a decent screen size, that could play games, that could stream movies (Netflix, Prime), that could check e-mails, that could Skype, etc. all while remaining affordable (under $100). I have yet to see a tablet in this price range that can do all these things effortlessly, while remaining this affordable. This tablet has handled whatever I throw at it, and with no hiccups. I had the cheaper $50 Fire tablet prior to this one, and that thing was slow to process the most basic tasks. If you\\'re looking for an affordable tablet that can do what a more expensive tablet can do, then pick this one up. Purchased as a replacement for an older kindle and the fire HD did not disappoint. The intended recipient was thrilled that a camera came with it. Well worth the money. 4th amazon product I own it is a great budget tablet. Bought for the daughter for Christmas and seems to work great Bought this for my wife for Christmas (a perfect gift, if I do say so myself), and seeing the joy that it brings her on a near daily basis makes me want one for myself. Alas, it will be another six years in the sequin mines outside Nashville until I can save enough to get another one. But someday... I purchased this during the black friday sale. I\\'m happy with the overall product with the exception of two things.1.) the auto brightness control is not good enough for me, its either too bright or too dark. I can\\'t figure out if I\\'m having issue with the colors or something else.2.) the 2nd issue is not with the tablet itself but after using this for a while i\\'ve realized using 8\" tablets for watching movies is not a good experience. For the price this tablet is an absolute steal! I\\'ve never had an iPad to compare it to but that\\'s only because I\\'ve never wanted to spend hundreds of dollars for a tablet. Recently upgraded from the 7inch kindle and i must say huge improvements. all i can say is that if they can speed up the processor by next year with more ram they might compete with the ipad! The tablet was a good gift for Christmas. I bought it on black Friday for a cheap price For my 3-year-old, it serves it purpose and very cost effective. I put a memory card in this and put the Play Store on it (Google it). I use it as a mini office with a Bluetooth keyboard. I love it. This 8\" tablet is much better than the older 7\" tablet. It is faster and have a camera. Great improvement over the older version. This is an awesome tablet, fast, great HD display and has all the apps I need for personal entertainment. If you look for a great tablet for entertainment, surfing the net, or reading your e-mail, this is the best you can have. I also purchased a 128 GB SanDisk Ultra Plus memory card. I strongly recommend it, not for work but it’s great for entertainment. Great size. Works with all apps. No issues yet. Would buy more. bought this for my son(12), and he loves it. Constantly on it. Got a great price during the holidays. Completely satisfied. This Amazon Fire is perfect for what I need - nice screen and memory size, really nice apps preinstalled and it\\'s just ready to use! The Black Friday price was beyond wonderful!!!!! Gifts for 4 yr old grandsons very easy for them to maneuver around.. great charge life. We have to force.them to take breaks. I bought this tablet for myself for Christmas! I\\'ve enjoyed the ease of use and the price I paid was great. In fact, I purchased another for my son for Christmas. This is the perfect tablet for basic use or if upgrading from the kids edition of the Amazon Fire. Much less expensive than an iPad and more durable if you have a tween who isn\\'t always careful with their tech. This was the first time I had a tablet. It is so much fun to play games on! Prefer no amps on unit and just allow buyer to place the amps they want or will ever use. Had to chose between Fire 10 and Fire 8. For the money, you can\\'t go wrong with the Fire 8. Screen is good for \" older eyes\". I have been holding off buying one of these for years, but on black friday the price was an astonishing $49. The amount of tablet you get for that amount of money is unrivaled. It is a great investment if you enjoy books or media. Great for kids, my kids haven\\'t stopped playing with it This is perfect for kids. The parental controls make me feel secure in letting my child use the tablet safely. I would recommend this to other grandparents for their grandkids this works great if you use amazon a lot and watch movies from amazon Great product for surfing the internet or reading books! I am familiarizing my self with no conclusion to say something about it now. I was expecting an Android device and discovered it was an \"Android like\" device. My fault for not reading up on his device before hand. I returned the Amazon Fire and bought a Samsung Tab E.I probably would recommend this tablet if you wanted a device for reading. Bought this as a gift for my aunt and she loves it. Easy to get connected and set up. She is totally non-techny and was able to do it herself. Great buy! I was surprised by the quality of the screen, and it is no slouch either. I love this Kindle and bought it for the upgrades to replace my original kindle fire. I would give it an excellent rating if the camera were better but the pictures come out grainy and not very clear. Great for watching shows and videos and these are very clear.. Love playing games on it and of course reading the latest books. Was looking for an inexpensive tablet for our child. Got this while on sale and ordered a screen protector and child case. Has worked well. Can set daily limits to prevent them from using to much. Would buy again. If adding more than one child to the account, the screen will not rotate properly for the second, third, or fourth child. Geek squad could not fix this problem, seems to be a manufacturer\\'s issue. Also, there are too many adds. I returned this product. I brought Fire HD8 for my Daughter, She have been used it since Christmas. Bought it on sale for Christmas gift and we\\'ll worth the money. Does everything needed with good functionality. Easy to use for those not too tech savvy. Bought this as a gift - they seemed to like it. The price was nice and so was the size of it. This tablet is more often used than my ipad, the free games from amazon underground is cool with amazon prime and if you like to read it has plenty of book options and integrations with digital purchases! This is a great device. I needed something small to read books on. This device is exactly what I was looking for. Purchase this tablet during the Christmas holidays on sale. Got as a gift for my job\\'s Christmas gift party. The person who got it was very happy with it. I am familiar with the tablet because I bought one for my wife when they first came out for her to use to read her books. Good tablet for book reading and audio books, many good apps to chose from. Very good for picking up e-mail when traveling. I\\'m still finding more ways to use it. Only had it about a month. My nephew likes the \\'large\\' size of the Fire tablet as it\\'s significantly larger than his phone. This is a great little tablet especially for the price. The new tablet is great ！ nice upgrades！Love how easy it is to use. Easy to get apps, shop and browse the web. Nice deals on the product with saving and good customet experience. I bought the Kindle Fire HD as a Christmas gift for my mom. She has never had a computer or Kindle. She loves it. Best gift I gave her. She plays a lot of games on it. That keeps her mind working. Love the size of screen. Purchased for my nephew for Christmas. He loved it and really enjoy it for playing games and reading books. Purchased this for my nephew. He loved it and can\\'t stop playing with it. I bought this as a light-weight alternative to an iPad for collecting and enjoying Kindle and Amazon Video products. When combined with the dedicated Fire cover, it\\'s low price along with a very readable screen and the option for a Micro SD card make it an excellent choice for travel and time spent in waiting-rooms, etc., allowing lots of memory space for ones library as well as flexibility regarding how it is held or positioned. My grandson broke his Amazon fire table one day after warranty expired. He was disappointed. So I bought him an 8 version . He had a big smile. This serves every function I need in a tablet. Price is right. It\\'s a handy little tool to have for reading e-Books. Bought this as a gift but was wrong item wanted so wasn\\'t used Easy to use, fast, sleek and battery holds good charge , happy with it Very easy to use and navigate. Perfect size to carry in my purse and still a good sized screen to watch movies. This product is very user friendly and it is very lightweight this was great buy & can do it all.fair price & great games Most of the time I use the tablet for the Web, reading and email, but when I want to work on a Word doc, pdf, budget and a lot more, I can do it well on the tablet without pulling out my laptop. The screen isn\\'t as sharp as the S2 models but is nice enough and it does not lack anything else. This was bought primarily for photos. I added the 128 card. Putting in the 128 card might have been a little tricky but the sales rep did it for me. My wildlife photos look brilliant on the tablet. I\\'d recommend making a Geek Squad appt for about an hour after you plan to buy the tablet. That way you learn how to use it before leaving the store. Also I got one that had been returned but all the parts still had the plastic wrap on them. That made it $100 less and hence the \"great deal\" in the title. It may pay to ask about a return. I plan to take some of the free classes offered. It was well worth the Black Friday price! The screen is so clear, it is easy to handle especially for people with not so big hands, easy and fast when navigating. I liked the volume buttons on the side of my old 7\" Fire better than on top like this new 8\". That\\'s the only reason I didn\\'t give it a 5 star rating. i just adore my fire 8...the features, size of screen, easy log in and graphics This is an awesome tablet. it is fast with great pictures! Price was right, great tablet for playing games and reading I got this tablet for Black Friday at a decent price. It\\'s 8 inches, you can add more space with a micro sd and very easy to use. Tablet works great. Nice big size good battery power. No problems using it. I am still learning all the different things I can do with the Kindle Fire. So far I like it. Perfect product for senior citizen who just wants to do a little internet shopping and receive and send emails. Nice size screen and easy to use. Great gift for a lot less investment than an ipad or laptop. Great buy for the money, no complaints. Highly recommended. I bought this as a gift and the recipient loves the processing speed and the fact that it has 2 cameras on the device. I am very happy with the kindle fire hd 8. it is very easy to use. I bought this for my mother for Christmas. She is not the most technological advanced individual. She really wanted a tablet and this one works great and is super easy to use. I went to program it for her and she insisted on doing it herself. She was able to no problem! Easy to use tablet. Price is pretty good. My mom loves it. Bought this tablet for a relative for Christmas who wanted access to audiobooks. My only issue is that the tablet needs a wifi connection in order for the audio to work with certain apps. Not a problem if you have constant access to wifi but my relative does not. Nice tablet otherwise. This device completely meets my needs for reading and accessibility. Works good, has very nice screen brightness and resolution I bought this tablet for my 9 year old. Easy to use and awesome graphics. Easy for adults to manage apps and parental controls. When my husband and I bought our Kindle Fire 8, we went to Best Buy and asked questions as best we could. There are programs we apparently need to put create and edit documents and spreadsheets!! We did ask if it had those features and was told yes but I think we need to have a special app. Why isn\\'t there a manual or step by step guide on getting the most use out of Kindle Fire 8. Can I get it online? Kindle Fire 8 fun to use but needs more info for customers. Can we go to a class at Best Buy? Thanks for any help. Great tablet for the price point....especially if you are big Amazon user.Expandable memory is a great feature. The kids more expensive tablets died twice. Repair was more than the Fire brand new. I would buy another one for the priceGood product My teenager loves to read and we purchased it for her. Great purchase! Would give 5 stars but THE ADDS!!!!!! Just as functional as my iPad Replaced Kobo EReader with this tablet, very satisfied with performance and price. Upgraded from a standard kindle to a kindle fire. Lots more features and about the same price.. I would definitely recommend this for anyone who wants a tablet but doesn\\'t want to pay a lot of money.. This was a great Christmas gift for my kid. This allows them to store their favorite books and play some educational games. Its nice to also have an optional MicroSD card for extra storage. works great for reading or playing games it connects to the web fast and responds very well I got this on black Friday for my mother and so far she enjoys it. It was to replace her iPad mini 1 that they have basically designed to become in operable within 2 years. She can add storage to the Kindle, the picture is fire, and she can read a plethora of books that suit her fancy. It\\'s nice size and responsive. Perfect for face timing with family. Perfect for travel. Convenient and way to use. First tablet for me. Very happy. Bought two tablets for the kiddos. Overall, price was great and works well. Only issue is download speed. Tends to take a while to download apps and other stuff. I love this! I use it daily! And I love the fact that I can add a ad card for more memory! Love it and would recommend it for the young as the old Kids got the kindle fire for Christmas, pretty happy with it. Purchased on black Friday deal for $59.99. Good buy! Not iPad quality but a fraction of the price and nice for watching prime videos and normal apps. Would purchase at standard price also as a fun extra tablet. Bought this tablet for my wife and she likes it. She plays a few games, checks her email, and goes on Facebook. High end users would not be satisfied with this tablet but overall an excellent value. Unable to download the Instagram app. which stinks I had an Apple Mini Ipad that was an older version and ran very slow due to older version OS I was told. I bought the Fire to replace it since I mostly use it for gaming through my WIFI. It was way cheaper and does everything I wanted and is very fast. No issues waiting for uploads. It has all the other features as well like weather, camera , and I have started to use Alexa and that is great. Nice size screen. Very fast easy to use nice size nice screen I bought this for my husband who is in a nursing home to be able to listen to music.. He loves it... And uses it every day for music and other things too. I love my old kindle, but after a few years and drops the power button doesn\\'t like to work a lot of the time. So took advantage Black Friday deal to replace the one that is going out. Basically, the tab\\'s features are good. There are huge Amazon collections. Kids can be allowed to use it without parents monitoring as parents control feature is good. Several useful Amazon products are offered free of charge. I hope that It is worth for the money value. nice tabket for the money with many nice features and durable I love the kindal because i am a reader. i able to check out books from library through overdrive but if i get an alert about world event i simply go to ond of the news app\\'s and get the latest headline. Great price. Love this tablet! Super bright colors! Great for gamers! Can\\'t bet this tablet for any price! I love reading my books on this, and the Alexa flash briefings each morning before I go to work at top notch The kindle fire hd is a wonderful tool as well as a device for entertainment. The beauty of the kindle fire is the price. I look forward to buying updated devices. My son enjoys it no complaints works great long battery life holds a charge better than any tablet i have ever had nice size, very clear but randomly shuts off. cant remove unwanted apps from the home screen. if you watch video..it buffers alot and laggs. love it, can do alot of stuff on it, would recommend fire hd8 to everyone This is the 3rd Kindle Fire that I have purchased. This one is much faster and more user friendly. We just bought our 2 grand daughters and 2 grandsons a Kindle Fire with the youngest 8 yrs old. He has it mastered already. Great tablet for a good price. Being used to an Ipad this is difficult to adust to but does the job just fine for a low price - good size to carry around without weighing down your purse. Would buy again This is an awesome product love the flexibility it has with not only book reading but other apps as well. Received this tablet as present for young grandson. While I am not an Amazon tablet fan (don\\'t like hybrid operating system), this device meets all the requirements I had hoped for: ease of use, optional micro SD capacity, and plenty of internal memory. No technology is ever like a real book you can smell, but this little notebook in nice. It does so many things well. This is my second kindle. Love size of screen and it is super light. Great camera. We originally owned an original kindle but it was slow app store was not the best and overall interface was to be desired. In fact eventually the device crashed and couldn\\'t be recovered with limited use. Deeply debated about getting another and actually bought a Samsung tablet, but it was too small. This was such a good deal it was hard to ignore and have been very happy to give another try. This device is a great size and much better interface. Would buy again and will consider in the future for the kids. My daughter loved it nd I love that she leaves my phone alone now. We ordered one for each of our 2 boys (ages 7 and 5) as Christmas gifts. They love them. Setup took a bit of time to get the Amazon store and parental controls, but well worth the time once its was all set up. We set it all up before wrapping them so the kids could enjoy them right away. It\\'s their favorite gift this year. Easy to use and great quality. All 3 of my kids have a Kindle Fire I bought this e reader for myself and I love it. The price was great and the product is nice. I got this for myself on black Friday. I have had 2 Kindles before but never the Fire. Love it! I love the fact that is very practical and I didn\\'t have to spend a lot of money. Well my kids love them. So that\\'s great for me. The only bad thing I can say is i can\\'t figure out how to make it so they can download free games and not ones that cost money. Got this kindle on black Friday for a great price. It is a good performer at a great price. I use it as a nice versatile tablet, not just for kindle bok reading. Wow this tablet for the price of 40$ at the time what a value. Works very well, easy to use, great for beginners. I\\'m not very good with electronics, so I was worried about learning how to use my Kindle Fire. I had no problems at all with navigation of this device. I feel it\\'s also fast I was expecting it to be sluggish. I think this is great for the beginner and is a great bargain. This imy 3rd kindle device.I chose it becazuse it haf more memory/stoeage This is a great tablet plus you can\\'t beat this price. I got this tablet on Black Friday. It was a great price, and being a Prime member, it has become my favorite entertainment venue on the go. The screen\\'s not as sharp as an iPad or Samsung tablet, but for the price I got it for and its entertainment value, it can\\'t be beat. I bought my fire tablet during the Christmas sale season for a great price to replace my aging iPad. I am really impressed with the speed of downloads and the quality of the video. I added an inexpensive SD card to download videos and shows. It is great for travel. The fire hd 8 is a nice improvement over the 7\" model. First, the extra ram makes browsing noticeably smoother and the screen is crystal clear. It is not on the same level as apple ipad or samsung galaxy, but still a huge improvement over previous kindle tablets. I bought the Amazon Fire HD 8 for my husband for Christmas. He\\'s never too excited about gifts but he is using this tablet every day and even though he won\\'t admit it, he absolutely loves it. Would definitely buy again, especially during Black Friday specials. Easy to use, size is just right. Easy for my wife to travel with and carry in her purse. As a low priced 8\" tablet, it has a good display, good speed, and reasonable battery life.I am a bit peeved by the rather intrusive adds that Amazon pushes onto it.I am also unhappy that I cannot load all the apps I am used to using on my Android phone. Overall, I wish I had spent more for a real Android device rather than having this with the Amazon limited version of Android. This tablet was a gift to my daughter because she\\'s an avid reader and anime watcher. She has been nothing but excited since she opened it and there have been zero complaints. My kindle fire HD8 is quite an upgrade to my old Kindle. Camera is a terrific addition and the screen is so much better. Got an unbelievable deal!! The best part is having a library of books at my fingertips!! Easy and simple to set up and great when I\\'m traveling!! I bought this for my daughter and she loves it! Works great for YouTube, Netflix and adding a few games. Easy to learn how to use and no \"accidental\" purchases can be made if you use the option to switch user accounts. My boys love their new tablets due to the cool features, books, apps and games. I love the parental controls, processor speed, battery life and light weight. Combined with a great discount at Best Buy and you get a win, win, WIN! I was using this for a while it was 10X faster then my kindle 5th generation yes 1gb of ram but the App Store made from Amazon is not the best so I downloaded the google play store to get the apps I mostly used I only use my kindle fire had 8 for books and reading or watching YouTube or the web I\\'m giving the rating 4 stars If you are using Amazon Prime, you definitely like this table as it can stream the video, audio, reading book... easy to carry with you I\\'ve had kindles since they first came out love it Perfect for my elderly mom to play games and use for reading It is a good tablet, but is a little slow downloading apps Great for what it is. The product is solid. Got it as a gift for family. Bought as a gift for my Mom. She\\'s so happy. Therefore, I\\'m happy Excellent resolution and speed. I love the easy usability of the new fire. I got this for my sister as a gift. So far so good. The price was just right. My daughter loves her tablet....she takes it with her everywhere! I had to sideload google play services to be able to download from the google play store or use google chrome as a web browser, as this tablet was designed to be exclusive to Amazon. I used daily and its works awesome, the price and performance are good I suggested to my friends , bought last yrs as well gave to my dad, he loves it. the kindle is all way a good product for the money the hold family have one just got me the 10\\' and love it get a Kindle and same money at the same time It\\'s big then the one I had I would tell my friends I purchased this Fire Tablet as a Christmas gift for my husband. He is learning to use it and so far likes it really well. He hasn\\'t downloaded any books yet but he now has an email address and will soon have a Facebook account. His brothers & sisters live around the country so now he will be able to keep in contact with them. Purchased for my granddaughter and it was a great investment. This little $60 tablet is really good for reading ebooks and watching netflix My Hulu plays perfectly..great volume. Kindle starts right up so I\\'m able to read fine. However, when I\\'m on Facebook and click on an article to read, it goes to the page, and within 30 seconds, the page closes. Sometimes Facebook app won\\'t even load. I find it blanking in and out and not showing some icons at times. I haven\\'t dropped it so I\\'m assuming this is an internal problem :( I have tried playing a couple games and it will say that I need \"the Amazon app\" where I go to purchase stuff, which I already have...then it closes out saying ERROR. I wish I could replace for a new one. Nice size screen, clear and clean picture with plenty of storage I bought two of these kindles. One for my preteen granddaughter whom had no problem at all being up and running. However, My senior mother found that the touch screen was not sensitive enough for the menu to drop easily for her. As a first time user on the kindle fire my mom will take time getting used to it. However, my tech savvy granddaughter loves her already. This replaced my old original kindle fire. What a great upgrade. Thought it was to be better than what it is. Mother in law can play games an Facebook on it. Next time I will buy her a samsung It was on a total of an hour and a half when the screen went completely dark. Would not turn on after that. The battery was fine....It just quit working all together. Bought this for my 9 year old Godson and he loves it. He would play it for hours on end if his parents would let him. He mostly plays games on it but he also uses it to watch videos and read books. Easily added apps including Google Play store... Not rocket science. Battery life is phenomenal, great for cross country flights. The granddaughter loves it and she can\\'t put it down. We bought this to replace a Kindle Fire pad and they have come a long way in this build, I would recommend this or if you like a bigger one then get then10\" version. Great build qualityGood screen resolution for the moneyCan install android applications -including kodi Like this so much bought another one for my daughter. My husband and I were looking around for a tablet for our daughter. We wanted something that she could use easily and we wouldn\\'t have to worry about what she was doing. With the different profiles and parental controls available we have enjoyed our choice of this tablet. Bought this for our granddaughter. She absolutely loves it! Easy for her to learn how to operate. First of all, this is not an iPad or a more expensive android tablet, but it\\'s a very good tablet for the money. I own an iPad Pro and iPad Air 2, yet this tablet has a place in my home. If you\\'re buying for kids, I wouldn\\'t buy anything more expensive than this. Good screen, fast enough, and amazon\\'s underground free apps are a huge plus. I bought this on super sale as an e-reader and to use to browse the web in lieu of a laptop when traveling. I found it to be a great value for the price. It processes rapidly on the web through its Amazon Silk browser. Streaming music also works well. The screen has nice resolution. It does not play well with other operating system apps and the apps available through Amazon does not compare to Google. I was unable to download a Google play app, although G mail works like a champ. The camera does not produce decent images. I wouldn\\'t bother with that function. All in all a terrific buy for the money, but don\\'t expect an iPad. Good tablet but not as smooth as high end tablets. It\\'s limited to Amazon so don\\'t expect to do as much as an Android or iPad. I like mine and will continue to use it. I recommend using one if you can before buying. I love it.....................!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! The Unit works exactly as described. A very good buy. Great tablet for price. Display is clear. Enjoy books on tablet. It\\'s unfair for me to rate this product cause I have not even taken it out of the box to set it up. Kids love it. Easy setup was ready with in minutes Working Product at the price that was advertised! Great! It\\'s nice really nice. Go buy one for your grandma. She will give you a real big hug. Easy to load, works with our local library (borrow books for free). I have been using this for a bit now. It\\'s wonderful. I also have another tablet but use the kindle exclusively for reading. The kindle works extremely. If you use amazon prime this is a no brainer. Great speed and function for a small price. Does what I needed. I would recommend to others great playing games reading surfing the Internet.Camera works very good and easy upload photos when needed. This tablet works as expected. I would recommend this tablet to anyone who needs a new tablet with great battery life. Very good tablet my child enjoys it very much, the battery life is very good although he takes it for his games Delivers as advertised. Very fast performance and the kids love it Absolutely love the tablet. My wife loves it. Much more enjoyable than playing on the phone. Not an iPad, but that\\'s not what I wanted. High quality, does everything I need it to do. Great purchase. Would definitely recommend it to anyone. Not very user friendly and intuitive.Very limited capabilities and apps.Good for viewing movies.Very limited language capabilities other than English and a few other languages.Apps are downloaded, but can\\'t be found. Now all 5 of my children have a kindle. This one is by far the best one. Currently setting everything up on it but so far so good. Very good price good item. Would purchase again. This was a gift I\\'ve had my Fire HD 8 2015 for about a year and have been very satisfied with it. My wife has been using an older Fire 7 (non-HD) and I thought it was time for an upgrade for her so I decided to buy her this new Fire HD 8 for Christmas. I also installed a sceen protector, a new case and a 64GB SD card before wrapping it.She was very surprised and pleased and she noticed the big difference in speed, sound and picture quality immediately. I\\'m very happy she likes it so much. Thanks Amazon for the great product and Best Buy for the great price. Very satisfied with my tablet ,it is very easy to operate. Purchased 2 of these and am real satisfied with them!! This actually was a Christmas present for my Mother, but I had to set it up. This is a nice upgrade from her Kindle purchased three years ago. Kindle was great assisting getting it registered since neither of us could remember her password. Great picture, just the right size and has the blue dimmer Met and exceeded all expectations! Easy to use, perfect size, arrived when expected and an excellent value. Not many apps. The first one was already returned...no power issue after 1week..I hope the second one is fine... awesome tablet. wonderful upgrade from the first kindle fire We are a Kindle family! Use them all the time! Reading books, checking email, watching Netflix. Would be very sad without it!!! For the money this tablet has a great display and allows you to do pretty much the same that lots of other more expensive devices are capable of. Bought this for my daughter for Christmas. She absolutely loves it! She has been on it since she opened it. Grandkids each got one and they love it. Step up from original Kindle. I recieved this as a present for my birthday, so far it has been great. I have bought several books and it makes a great Ebook reader. This is a great tablet for the price I paid. My husband loves it! Great tablet! My son really likes it to read and also to play games! Great buy for my 7yr old cheap so if it ends up broken for any reason I can replace it easily. Purchased for a family member. They love it. Would Recommend. I was always an IPad person but after having this I\\'m fine with it. It\\'s easy to use and inexpensive. Was happy to get the toy for my son for Christmas and they won\\'t stop playing it Purchased for mother in law as a Christmas gift and she loves it. She had a version 1 and she loved. She loves the better sound, picture and speed of the newer version. Bought for my daughter she loves it. Great investment for her watching movies!! Got this on sale for 69, decent display but you can tell it is not on par with other tablets. It is great if you have prime and use their services. Great speakes, makes a huge difference in Audio quality. Battert life is good, no complaints. I gave it 4 stars due to the play store access. There is a way around it, I do have it on here now but it took some work. Purchased two Fire8 tablets for my children. My son loves it for reading books from library and my daughter loves listening to audio books.They both were not sure they would like the tablet but they really love them. Love the HD8 the extra inch makes a huge difference over the HD7. I bought this on line as a gift. The unit does not stay on and I cannot get in touch with anyone to get the unit repaired This is a great device, and free\\'s up my phone. Great for internet, games, radio, etc. Simple to use. Great for Dad who wants to play games and check weather Product worked as described. No issues with performance, and it was a simple setup! Perfect for web browsing and videos. I love my tablet. It is super easy and loads fast. Bought this for a new tablet user. After a quick training session she caught right on. Perfect size for me. Speaker clarity is amazing and produces a great picture This is a great tablet without the steep cost of an iPad. I haven\\'t used it too much so far but the picture and sound is pretty good and being able to stream movies/shows is quite nice. I bought this fire for my 7 year old and she loves it. This is the first tablet i have owned and i must say it runs great. And the battery lasts for a good amount of time. Cant complain when it comes that cheap. The battery charge life is extended and everything else is fine. Great little tablet. Inexpensive so easy for taking with you without worry. This is a great value product and is (for me) an equal to an ipad. great tab in low price and worth to spend. It has everything what i am looking for. This kindle is very convenient and has a great display that\\'s easy on the eyes. I enjoy my kindle fire had it is easy to use get it I really like the bigger screen. These are great for traveling with children Hadn\\'t really checked into Kindles/tablets before. Does more than I expected it too, tho now I\\'m a little disappointed that it\\'s a little limited to Amazon-related and approved stuff. The app store for the device is more limited even tho it uses a form of Android (which means no Flash also). But I\\'m mostly using it for reading, so I\\'m happy with it and would recommend it. The 8 was the perfect size for me, the 6 screen was too small for reading comfortably and the 10 was too big as a handheld. This was an upgrade purchase. My previous Kindle was 4 years old. (still working!) This new version is so much faster and has a much better quality camera! Love it for reading, Netflix and on-line shopping! I don\\'t know why it takes long to come on and it goes off on me my kids have no problem Overall I am happy with my Amazon Fire 8 HD. It was easy to take and use on a recent trip, although the Delta app doesn\\'t work with it so that was a little frustrating. Not crazy about seeing the ads that pop up, but for a purchase price of $65 (sale), it\\'s hard to complain. This is my first tablet and I find it to be the perfect size and easy to use. I would recommend it to anyone who wants to buy a tablet and expects to use it for reading, surfing the web, playing games and as a lightweight device travel option. I am very happy with the look of the games and everything on the screen, I can see myself using it more at home now, although I will still use my laptop when I want a bigger screen. I bought it in the store & they were out of cases, so I recommend buying a case that also acts as a stand. I found one on Amazon that was inexpensive and came in an array of colors. Purchased this as a child\\'s tablet and I couldn\\'t be happier! I was buying it thinking that it would be cut-rate but ok for a small child to play with on long car rides and on rainy days. Despite the low cost and unimpressive stats I have been very surprised by the quality. The screen is perfectly adequate for games and kids shows, the parental controls/child profile settings are excellent and the stereo speakers CRUSH the built in speakers on my iPad Air 2. The only drawbacks I have found so far are power related. The battery seems to drain fairly quickly under what I would consider normal use and the included charger (typical usb type) takes a very very long time to fully charge the tablet. I suspect this is the charger\\'s limitation rather than the tablet\\'s and it may charge better with a different power supply.I wish that I had purchased two of these tablets at the price they were for sale and I would have kept the second for my own use when on the road. Gave this to my sister-in-law for Mother\\'s Day. Its a great entry level tablet. She loves using it, especially for games. I got this tablet for my dad after his old tablet bit the dust. He loves it! Great tablet and features! One of the fastest tablets I ever had. Netflix and Hulu works awesomely! I have the 2015 generation fire and it never worked all that great as far as speed but I enjoyed the feel and the visuals of it. I just purchased the 2016 version and it is remarkably faster than the previous model. Though the newer model doesn\\'t have as nice of a feel and the visuals are not as good. The newer version was much cheaper in price so it explains the feel and visuals. I hope someday they get a model that looks and feels great and is also quick. This is my third kindle fire. It is lightweight and unobtrusive. I use it mostly for reading however I have had no issues using it for web browsing or for playing games. Overall a good little tablet for the price. This was a Mother\\'s Day gift from my son. I had wanted one for awile. It has surpass my expectations. I love it. Perfect if you\\'re looking for the basic necessities of a laptop. Only negatives no yahoo apps, no google apps, no apple app, but it\\'s still awesome. I love my Amazon fire. I purchased one for my 17 year ol and she uses it to view Netflix,Hulu and you tube. I shop,email, surf the net and pay bills with mine:-)I bought an extra and downloaded my fire1. Now I have a fire 1 and a fire 2. My fire 1, my husband uses, so for back up I have a fire 2. It takes nice pics as well. The fire will make a very nice gift for someone oh, don\\'t forget your free books you can download!! Bought this as a gift/prize for a Project Graduation party. The winner was super excited! This kindle does everything i want and more. No regrets on the purchase I purchased this tablet for my mother-in-law and she loves it. Its fast, connects well, every amazon aspect of life you could possibly want is on here. Thats what I didnt expect, it being my first tablet. Amazon gets in your face about all its promos and products every time i turn it on. Its so annoying. -But its very handy, very sleek, easy to use and connects quick to any wifi acess around. However its limited on games and its app store is c.r.a.p compared to android. So ehhh 50/50. Late gift for my grandson. He is very happy with it. Easy for him (9yo ). I\\'m not super thrilled with the proprietary OS on this unit, but it does work okay and does what I need it to do. Appearance is very nice, price is very good and I can\\'t complain too much - just wish it were easier (or at least more obvious) to port new apps onto it. For now, it helps me see things that are too small on my phone while I\\'m traveling. I\\'m a happy buyer. I purchased this Kindle Fire HD 8 was purchased for use by 5 and 8 yer old grandchildren. They basically use it to play Amazon games that you download. Great tablet for a great price. No need to purchase an overpriced tablet for children I haven\\'t had my Fire long enough to have explored all it has to offer. I\\'ve downloaded a couple of audio books that sound great and are easy to install and play. Not my way to watch movies or TV but the screen is nice. Very clear and sharp. Audio is just OK from the speakers, you\\'ll want some nice head phones or buds for music or movies. I really like the Fire 8, it seems like a lot of gadget for the money. I use this tablet often. It is the perfect size. The battery last a long time. The quality is great for the price Easy operation, great product, not a fan of the shiny screen, hard to see in sunlight Love my purchase of my Amazon fire Hd 8. It was a very good experience Love it, vivid HD color, it replaces other devices I have. Watch movies, play games, read e books. Happy with the purchase, found it on sale could not pass it up! the salesgirl was very knowledgeable and helped me pick out the right tablet for my needs. It works well as promised. Good size screen and clarity for the money. Seems fairly robust. The biggest problem is putting apps on it, at least free games. They do not have a great selection and when I put them on some of them require you turn on tracking so they can collect information or they won\\'t let you play it Good tablet overall just not enough memory but with an sd card just love it It was great and great for the kids and adults thanks my 9 yr old loves her new tablet . she had a nabi and likes this better Love the Tablet. Wonderful battery life. Great for Movies. This is a good tablet for the price. I dont have a lot of apps. I use more for reading and watch videos. I think is a good deal. I bought this item for one of my interns and she loved it. it\\'s a great tablet for the money. I would buy another. It does everything I need a table to do. And it is really fast.. The product has a $90 price tag and the 90 warranty is too short. My tablet died within a month. I took it to Best Buy where they said they don\\'t handle the warranty, went to Amazon web site where they said go to the store where I bought the device. After much digging around Amazon web site I found out who would help me. I gave it a one star and Amazon helped me quick. We were able to get it going again, a manual would help. The device works again. I found the tablet to be very functional, I watch Netflix, listen to Spotify, watch YouTube videos, it works great! Excellent product for what it does. Spouse loves it!Nough said! Easy to use and lots of handy features. Downside is the ads that apparently can\\'t be shut off and you can\\'t upload and and play downloaded YouTube videos unless you are online. Works great for my teenage son. He uses it for reading, playing games, and watching movies I purchased this tablet for my granddaughter and she just loves it...so much I have to take on the week days ... I love this kindle works great for me I will be ordering another one today for my wife. \\xa0I needed a tablet to keep at the hospital during overnight stays so I decided based on price to get the kindle 8 and I am pleased I did! For only $89 the bright picture, sound, storage, and ease of use is well worth it. This is a great tablet for downloading books & movies. It also takes pictures as well as surfing the web. All in all very satisfied with purchase Very Nice upgrade! Love the speed to watch movies and to play games! I broke my Fire 7 and decided to move up to the 8 and could not be more happy. I bought this for reading but love the extras. Works great! Great reading options. I like my Amazon fire-easy to use - user friendly.I liked the size - 8\" . It has made my life much easier since having hand surgery! Easy to check my email and other uses! Absolutely love my kindle. There was a glare on the screen when I was out in the sun, but once my eyes got adjusted it was just fine! I was looking for a tablet within a reasonable price range, after doing a little research I decided to give the kindle a try and it was a GREAT decision! It has so many uses and makes it so much easier to get things done than using my phone. I would recommend for any age. I love my new kindle. It was a birthday gift to myself. Best decision I could have made. A lot of bells and whistle. I love it because it was to navigate. Heck, I am doing this review on my kindle. Best Fire tablet at a reasonable price. Much faster than the 7 inch. I like the size of the device as well as the expandable storage Bought this for my wife to replace her old one and she loved it Good enough for the price. Great for Amazon subscriptions and Amazon shopping. I enjoy the kindle fire but it is not meant for heavy lifting. Good for reading books and web searching but Amazon App store doesnt have many of the normal apps found in Google Play or Apple App Store. Great value for the price however wonderful, I have 3 more at home, worth the money. This is my second Amazon Fire. My first was the 7 inch and love the new 8 HD. I am impressed with the quality and speed of this tablet. I was a little worried about not having access to the Google Play store, but this has not been a big issue so far. The speed, functionality, and battery life have exceeded my expectations. Good for price. One should not expect the quality of iPad from this product Bought the device as a gift for someone and so can\\'t comment on the usage, however it was a good price for a device that seems very versatile to me. Bought this for my mom and she loves it. Very user friendly The only thing that I don\\'t like about it is that the screen is not made to be seen in the sunlight. If I wanted to take it to the beach or poolside to read, I would not be able to see it in the sunlight. Otherwise it is terrific! It\\'s a nice updated tablet. No problems yet. Decent price for what you get Replacement tablet for my wife - no complaints! She watches Netflix on it a lot. This tablet was inexpensive, very lightweight, and performs just as good as the more expensive ones. A rating of 3 starts is what I can give this product. The Fire HD8 show a nice picture and is used mostly to watch NetFlix. However, the Fire HD8 will restart when the battery indicators is at 35%. I am not sure what is causing the issue or why. Good product for listening to and reading books. Also works well when u don\\'t want to carry an expensive and heavy laptop. We use this for streaming and games. It is a great value for the money. My wife got this for her Kindle books so she can read on the go Mom likes this allot, once she started using it. She was hesitant at first because it\\'s something new! But that didn\\'t last long. Nice screen, got it at discounted price for my kid, replaced a smaller one he broke. Tip add a child proff cover. The migration executive experience amazing! Picked up from cloud and i was good to go! Good features, good cost. Recommend to anyone looking for tablet. Great product... easy to use! Compatible with everything I want to use it for. Bought this for my son,, the size is perfect not too small not too big. Kid friendly..and easy to use. Overall o rate it 5 stars..no problems to list I purchased this to download books for school. Screen too small and OS was not to my liking If you want a simple tablet to watch shows and play games this is it. The constant ads from Amazon are annoying however. Love this tablet. Easy to use. And price was right Bought it for tbe grandson to play games on. It is ok for that. I have had Nook tablets before and I think tbey are a little better than the Amazon. It does fine for what we bought it for. This is a great tablet for people that are new to tablets and do not want to spend much money on it. It\\'s a very nice tablet and very economic tool, my kids enjoy it and I love the parental controls too This was a present for my son, but he seems to be enjoying it, so it must be ok Nothing but problems after a month. Luckily I could take it back and get a credit for the kindle to put towards an ipad. It started off working fine then after a month it started losing internet connection randomly (while the old ipad had no problems). Then it stopped charging, never got past 1%. Tried different outlets, different android chargers. Nothing. Worthless It\\'s definitely a must have. I like to read books also browse social media and the web. Must have I really was looking for a simple, cheap tablet to play games and mess around on. Screen is really nice and it serves it\\'s purpose well. Video and games both work really well on them. The only real negative about the tablet is that the cameras are not good. I really don\\'t need them so I don\\'t use them and it\\'s not a big deal for me. Our daughter loves her new tablet. It has a bigger screen more features and she just enjoys being on it. The kindle is priced right and is easy to use. She was able to get her apps transferred to her new tablet in no time. Great investment. Best tablet for the money and then some, loads fast, good quality graphics too. I needed to upgrade my electronics since I haven\\'t bought a tablet in a couple of years. What I had at home wouldn\\'t stream what I wanted to see. I went in looking for a 10in and came out with this 8in after the sales assoc. showed me its features & answered my questions. Much more portable than a 10in would have been too. If you are looking for a tablet to read books, play games, watch netflix or amazon, and to travel with, look no further. This tablet has everything you need. it does not have the greatest camera, but you have a phone for that. No reason to spend more money on anything else. You get what you pay for... This is not great, the functionality and limitations leave much to be desired. Should have spent more and got another Samsung Galaxy Tab. Great for travel when you want to read in vacation. I really love my kindle its easy to handle to. I have 3. was cheap, can not run chrome stuff, returned to store. Bought this for my mom as an upgrade to her older non-HD Kindle Fire and it is an improvement on all fronts - bigger better screen, better speakers, faster processor and updated operating system plus a slot for external storage. Great price for what you get. Got this at a great price as a second tablet. The battery life is so good that I use when traveling for movie watching. Great screen and quick response times. I love my amazon fire tablet. It\\'s great to watch movies on and surf the web. I bought my daughter the kindle fire so i purchased the kindle 8 for me Better than nook also cheaper. If toy areally looking to use as a tablet not the best choice. Great for reading and basic searching. Love this tablet. Great price and does everything Iwas looking for in a tablet All four of my kids have this Kindle. They does freeze every now and again, but overall they are great. The new camera is not a favorite. The last version camera was better. My wife broke her kindle, so we tried the fire and she has loved it! About what you\\'d expect from Kindle. Bluetooth connectivity, battery life all good I bought this tablet to replace another one that had died. it works of my purposes but one thing to note this is an Amazon device and does not have google play services installed. all apps come from amazon market. I enjoy using this Kindle fire 8\". The apps are easy to install, the screen is a great size. I can even use it without my glasses. Got this tablet for my mother and liked it so much that I went and got one for myself! It runs fast for what I use it for! I bought this tablet for my 13 yr. old God-child and she loves it. This was her Christmas present. Bought it for my wife she loves it and I would but one for my self too Excellent value, great product. It has a really solid feel. I am very happy with the purchase. Have had a nook and this is easier to use and greater variety of uses and I greatly prefer it. Great apps,ease of use,love the 8in screen, camera not that great, better pics on phones this a great tablet, my grandaughter uses the kindle settings for her little girl who is in pre school This is an upgrade we purchased for Mom. She was able to use it with no problem. Alot like her previous Kindle Very happy with the Kindle tablet! Bought it to replace an old Kindle tablet. Great tablet, serves the purpose well. Basic browsing, netflix and amazon videos.Only issue is my older tablet had a mini hdmi not this one, so screen connect is only through Amazon echo.Still a good tablet! I use it to stream movies while on the tread mill at the gym This is a great Tablet at a really great price. The best part is if you happen to break it just buy a new one Bought this to replace one I had from about 6 years ago. Why did I wait so long. The newer models bigger screen is so nice and it\\'s so much faster! I HAVE NOTHING BUT GOOD THINGS TO SAY. I HAVE HAD NO PROBLEMS WITH THE TABLET AND IT KEEPS A GREAT CHARGE. GOT IT FOR A GREAT PRICE! I had bought this tablet for my sister who is wheel chair bound or she lays in her bed. She gets a lot of Joy from using the tablet.Its big screen helps her see things better. Upgraded from the original Kindle not sure why we waited so long. Works great!! Would recommend for anyone looking for a good product. Very kid friendly! WAS LOOKING FOR A NEW TABLET. .. GREAT PRICE FOR THIS ONE! This is perfect for him! Bought it as a reader for his books, which we either download from Amazon Prime or the local public library. Nice quality screen resolution, ease of use and durability are a plus. My grandson loves it, uses it all the time. Its great Great reader and tablet enjoy the video graphics nice unit. Really love my Fire HD. Very easy to browse the internet. Is an excellent EBook Reader. Amazon apps are great! The screen is big and the Kindle is easy to navigate. Having Amazon prime definitely makes it worth the investment Bought this for my elderly non-tech friendly mom. Because it\\'s so user friendly she\\'s able to navigate it and enjoy its features without assistance. It is better than we expected and couldn\\'t be happier. We love this tablet. I bought it for my 4 and 6 year old daughters for Christmas. They have been able to used them with ease. This is for my 10 year old. Love the parental settings This was my 3rd Kindle and 2nd Fire Kindle!!! I use it for EVERYTHING!!! Hardly use the laptop at ALL anymore. Would HIGHLY recommend!!! Mainly used for reading kindle books, but tablet does many other things! Goes with me everywhere I go! When I decided on this I was shopping for something but didn\\'t know what. After using I have decided this is it. Does all I need. I bought this tablet for my 4 year old granddaughters birthday and she loves it. Works well and it is easy for her to operate. Got as a gift for my mom for Mother\\'s Day . Really great This screen on the hd8 is a huge improvement over the past kindle or fire devices. The operating system is sometimes glitchy, but overall a nice system for the money. Be sure to join Amazon Prime and have access to lots of free reading downloads Affordable and kid friendly. My kids watch videos and play games on these a lot. Lots of apps, games and books to choose from! I bought this tablet to replace my old kindle fire. So far, it has exceeded my expectations. All my apps have transferred flawlessly. The battery lasts me 10-12 hours, with moderate internet use. Glad I made this purchase. We needed a new tablet and after some research this one seemed to fit our needs. Would definitely recommend this to anyone that is looking for a tablet. These two boys were thrilled with the Fire tablet. Every time I see them they are glued to the tablet. They both have said it is the best present EVER. Extra points to the grandfather on these gifts! Unsure if I wanted to get another kindle or an Amazon tablet. Very happy with my purchase. Easy to use and a great price! This is a great Amazon Fire HD8. I love the size. So much better than my first Kindle. has good download speed. great color and clarity. sound also very good Bought for grandson ,he loves it\\'s! He uses it daily after home work done. it was a good buy for when the had them on sale. I use it as my travel tablet I love this Kindle Fire....I bought it as a reader but really about the only thing I can\\'t do on it is make phone calls. Great price for a great product. The Fire 8 was purchased for me for after I had a knee replacement. I used it to view and check my emails, facebook, Netflix, Xfinity movies and TV shows. I had an older Kindle but it got a virus. The only thing I have against this one is that it gets very hot. Best Buy did not carry covers for it. got as a replacement for young child. worked well for him. This is a great value tablet, great screen great apps. Highly recommend for media/games. I\\'ll probably buy another We bought one for my son and he liked it so much we bought another one for my other son. We did upgrade to the 8 inch screen. Purchased it for in law. She loves it and has no problems with it. I bought this as a Christmas present on Black Friday for an incredible price Easy to use and has a lot of games and books available. Good memory and you can\\'t beat the price! I\\'m planning on returning this tablet just as soon as I can!` I bought this to replace a 3-year old Kindle Fire 7\" HDX that I had just dropped on the floor. I sort of panicked, so after doing a couple of hours of research I picked this tablet. Just to be on the safe side I got 16 additional GB of memory. I installed a couple of games (none of them memory hogs) and a cookbook app, in addition to downloading a couple of books and dictionaries. I can honestly say this is the slowest tablet I\\'ve ever had. Just rotating the screen takes 7-10 seconds, and that\\'s if there\\'s only one app open. Opening a book or magazine can take half a minute, and God help you if you want to switch between a recipe and a magazine while you\\'re cooking! Amazon is obviously more concerned about showing you constant special offers and apps than having satisfied customers. Since there are no other Fire tablets available for whatever reason (maybe they\\'re being discontinued?) I\\'ll be replacing it with either an iPad or a Galaxy tablet. Great starter tablet for any one looking to not spend much money. I bought this for a gift and my little niece got in love with it HD 8\" tablet 16G on sale for $64.99 thats $25 dollars less then ever before. And alexa included. Glad I upgraded to the Fire Kindle as it is much easy to read on than the black and white Kindle I had previously. The color and graphics are very clear. It is easy to work on for many tasks, and the search mode is great. Overall I am satisfied with the tablet. Nice looking screen and decent sounding speakers. Loads of content kids and adults. Nice device! This is our first tablet, we were looking for a tablet to get us started and this is nice and inexpensive way to get started. We will use this for a while to get used to the whole app thing. I bought this to replace an older kindle that broke. It has more features, like front/ rear facing camera and better resolution screen. I feel like it doesn\\'t work as well though. The screen doesn\\'t always respond. The Internet freezes a lot. The colors seem to be a little off. All in all, still a decent piece for the price. I purchased the Kindle fire to replace my iPad that stopped working. It is so much easier to use and lighter than an iPad. I wish I had purchased one years ago. Kindles are easy to carry when traveling on long flights. Can\\'t believe I waited so long to get a real e-reader. So easy to read from. Nice tablet from Amazon, has a good screen on it and plenty of memory. My grandson loves it! It\\'s exactly what he needed. I\\'m very pleased with it, and so is he! I loved my old kindle but this new kindle is easy to use and has added security that I didn\\'t have with my old kindle. as above but interface is confusing and swipes are sometimes not recognized. Great for games and reading. Price was great. Great battery life. Well worth the money. Its awesome and of course better than the last gen. Love the HD screen. Picked this up in hopes the kids would read more than usual. It worked not only that but the entire family enjoys it. Perfect size. Exactly what I was looking for. Highly recommend this to anyone. It works fine, but sensitive to swipe on one side. This tablet has worked perfectly since I got it in April. The special offers are only on the lock screen and it works with all my apps. It\\'s very responsive and the screen resolution is great. Easy to use and great selection of books movies and games. We got these as an upgrade for the kids\\' Kindle Fires. Work great and have had no issues. The specs are good, feels solid, can\\'t stand the OS. Too many ads you can\\'t get rid of, not as customizable as I\\'d like. If that doesn\\'t bother you, it\\'s a good tablet for the price. Don\\'t expect to run games on it, not powerful enough for that. I bought one and gave this one as a gift- much appreciated and great price. I needed something that\\'s not an ipad for basic app use and it works great, minimal glare even with a screen protector (again, it\\'s not iPad, but it\\'s good for a tablet) Very easy to use and does everything I need it to do. I use it to read emails and watch Netflix Very easy to use. The Kindle app works well. Regular tablet search simple games email all work fine sometimes a little slow. I used this as my travel tablet and teader. The advertising is a pain but helps keep the price down. Goo graphics and easy to use. Does much more than you think. A perfect gift. Great Fire tablet! Speedy service and experience! Bravo! This is a cheap tablet but really worth for the price. I bought this when it is on sale for $69 + $40 for 128 GB SD card, you have a great tablet when plenty of space. I used ipad for a while but i think it is so overpriced . This tablet is a deal !!! Excellent replacemwnt for an older model of rhe kindle. This is our 2nd one, my wife was using my most of the time, so I got her one. good little tablet. I use it for entertainment. no issues hooking it up to my network. It reads my textbooks to me while I play card games. Why did I wait so long to buy this thing? I should add that I am an Amazon Prime member so that might be needed to take full advantage of this feature. Cortonna will read all of my books to me. I didn\\'t have to upgrade my books or pay extra per book. Got this for my mom, so she could check facebook without getting on her computer. So far, no problems, even tho she\\'s not tech savvy. Enjoy having a device that I did not have to pay for through the nose. Enjoy having a device that makes it easier to read on the go. Great light weight tablet that uploads quickly. Would recommend. I need a tablet for reading ebooks and search dictionary for new vocabulary. This one fit my need and it can also check email, listen music and go online searching stuff. I have iPad at home and put this at office, so I don\\'t need to bring the same tablet back and forth. It suits my need very well. This is a very responsive device for the amount paid Amazon - Fire HD8 - 8 - Tablet - 16GB - Wi-Fi - Black I purchased this for my sister. I really appreciate the Geek Squad for setting this product up for her and for teaching me how to use it. Now I can pass that I learned onto my sister. Kindle was great purchase for both of my teenage sons.Great for use of apps and music. Good for everyday use. Would recommend to anybody. Inexpensive, but well built. Easy navigation. Streams movies well. Sound is decent, but requires headphones generally. Screen is good size and clear. Finding a case for this model is a challenge - I found on-line, but expensive considering tablet price. Universal cases don\\'t work due to button placement. 8 years old daughter is happy with this tables,work very well with wifi and is easy to download app. Perfect for basic stuff, games and media. Reading, too. Fast working tablet but very limited on apps. I like it but it was not really for me. Only apps available were from the Amazon app store so many apps that I hoped to use were unavailable. So it is good for limited use. Purchased for book reading but works well as a tablet. Wasn\\'t thinking that it would be a full replacement for my old IPad but working well as one. Prior to using the device I decided to recharge it to 100% and was shocked to find out that it takes 6 hours. Unless you have a lot of time don\\'t buy this device. whats to say.................................................it\\'s Kindlelishous!!!!!!!!!!!!! I purchased this as a Mother\\'s Day gift for my Mom in Florida. I don\\'t have first hand experience with it but the price point is great and the other reviews seem solid. I did watch a few unboxing videos on youtube and it seems to be a great deal. Some people seem to have issues with the screen being too glossy but other than that I don\\'t see a ton of other problems. This tablet has beautiful color graphics and is super thin. Easy to carry with you. This fit my criteria of a low cost tablet that works well My son loves his new tablet. He goes on it as soon as he gets home from school. and it holds a LOT of data plus you can add more storage... been using it a lot. Better than I expected. Parental control is an awesome feature. I was looking for a kids tablet for my grandson but this one is so much better because it can grow with him and it has a kids mode on it which is really nice so he can\\'t order or go online without permission. He loves this tablet and it\\'s very well build . We bought the Fire as an easy way for our 97 year old mother to see pictures of the family from all over the country. It was very simple to set up and learn to use. She plays games on it, as well...... Cant beat it for the money, plus its very durable.... My 8 year old niece cracked her screen on her former tablet, I needed to get her a replacement. This tablet fit the bill exactly, a great screen, relatively fast CPU, and best of all, it\\'s cheap!I was able to find instructions online for installing Google PlayStore, in which I then gave her the tablet. She loves it! I love the Amazon HD8! It is a great tablet for reading and surfing the web! It has a fast processor and amazing resolution. I would definitely purchase this product again. Great product for my 8 year & affordable.. had 2 months & no problems Great but I wouldn\\'t use it for a sole purpose as being my primary tablet A perfect tablet at a reasonable cost. Why pay higher prices for bells and whistles you don\\'t use. The back lit feature is great for reading in low light conditions. I got a kindle fire when they first came out. Time to update and great choice, good graphic, great for catching up on your favorites show better than watching on a phone!! The Kindle Fire HD is perfect for playing simple games and for streaming video while away from home. It\\'s thin and light. Bought this for my daughter. She loves it. Wifi connection is great. She mostly uses YouTube and google. Love the easy way to control parental accounts from my account. Very useful. I did buy a cover to put on it, because it\\'s so thin, I was afraid it would break. I bought this tab for my daughter\\'s birthday.its got a good screen and sound for the price. I also play for the children\\'s app freetime which is perfect for her. Really good tablet. Very nice picture. Really easy to use. I needed a kindle for my schooling so I decided to look into this and read some reviews. After reading the reviews I decided on this kindle and it is perfect compared to my other tablet. Like the ability to play a game or 2 when I take a break from reading... Easy to use, light weight, fits in a small purse or bag. I like the Amazon Platform that it is on as it ties into my Amazon account. still learning new things about my tablet. very easy to use.. perfect size. We have been using our Kindle Fire 7 for years and it wore out. We looked at replacing it with another Fire 7 until I saw the Fire 8. The display is great and the weight is not that big of a difference. Enjoy the multifaceted opportunities that are available with the Kindle This tablet is very easy to set up and use- it\\'s just as advertised. I had the original Kindle and just decided to upgrade. It \\u200bis a very functional and easy to use. My 10 year old daughter loves it. Battery great to Several friends suggested I buy the Kindle Fire. I love it!! Great for traveling! I can check my email, update my Facebook status and read all from one device. I had a new one but it stopped working....So I just went and bought a new one. Works great!! Loved it very good screen quality and clarity, of course its amazon so alot of the regular google play store stuff from androids isnt Available, but they have there own version of stuff that is good also, my kids loved it, i loved it, i highly recommend buying it. But if your hooked on google play id go with a Samsung tablet. Very lightweight and portable with excellent battery life. I like this so much more than the Voyage. The shape makes for easier holding. I only wish this devise was maybe 2 inches taller then it would look like a real book Replacing older reader without a light and traveling overseas soon. With electronics in the cabin under scrutiny, this very small and very lightweight reader fits the bill! Perfect in small purses and large pockets. I can read without annoying seatmate with cabin overhead seat light. Easy to hold in either hand and screen adjusts for whichever direction you\\'re holding it. This is my first e-reader. I didn\\'t know about the odd refresh and it took a little while to get used to but I do love how small and light it is and that I do not have to remember to plug it in everyday This kindle is awesome. I love the design of it. Nothing software wise that was different than my other kindle but the way it\\'s designed makes it much more comfortable and easier to read. The only reason I didn\\'t give it five stars was because of the price. If it were cheaper, this kindle would have been five stars no doubt. The new Kindle is a great gift and fantastic entertainment idea. Met all my expectations! Lightweight and compact. I enjoy using the product. I thought long and hard about upgrading from my paperwhite, but decided to do so despite not beating able to actually see one in the store. I have owned a Kindle since the second generation version. This is by far my favorite. The look and feel are amazing. I don\\'t regret the purchase one bit as I have the disposable income to do so, but for most the paperwhite will more than suffice at a significantly smaller price point. I own a Kindle HDX 8.9 and wanted something small and portable... WOW is all I can say when I got my hands on the Kindle Oasis ( Thank you Babes :) ). The Kindle Oasis is very tiny, portable & fits in about anything from a jeans back pockets to a very very small purse! The clarity of the screen is awesome. The touch of it works perfect! Very different than my HDX BUT I HIGHLY RECOMMEND it! A little more pricey than the paperwhite BUT this one already comes with the case and a built in battery in the case so you are set for long time reading & the price is fair since the others you would still have to buy a case for it! Keep in mind the case for the oasis is leather and you can choose from black, brown and red (red was my choice., which to me it\\'s not red it\\'s more of a wine red color) it\\'s beautiful! Picture shows My Kindle Oasis in the middle of the IPhone 7 Plus (left) & Samsung S8+ (right) so you can get an idea on the size... it\\'s super cute! It\\'s tinier than the Kindle paperwhite! Got me reading again! Love the merlot cover. This one is the smallest of all the kindle products I believe, and that\\'s a big reason I picked. Also the lightest I believe. Battery life is forever.Two negative points are the Amazon logo in the cover, and the fact you can\\'t do inverted text (black background white text).Those 2 points dropped it from 4 to 5 star for me.Still highly recommended. easy to read books this way. enjoyable at night in the bedroom or outside in the afternoon. I purchased the Kindle Oasis because I was growing increasingly tired of the glare and cumbersome size of reading off my iPad. So the portability is great. And of course, I went for the most expensive, because I wanted the extra battery life. And while the length of time it stays charged is nice, charges very quickly, it\\'s still overpriced. I love the non-glare screen, you can literally read this anywhere. But the wifi connectivity is patchy at best. I have to go upstairs in my home and stand close to the router for the Oasis to connect, this is very annoying. Wouldn\\'t be a big deal if I only read from this one device. But I read from another and picking up where I left off is a pain most times. Non of my issues are really a big deal, but for $300 I don\\'t feel like I should have any issues. This is my second Kindle and I couldn\\'t be happier . I couldn\\'t believe I would be happy with something so small , but it is great And easy to take along anywhere . I started to buy the Voyage but when I saw how close the price was to the Oasis, I decided to go ahead and buy the Oasis. So glad I did! I love the case and the physical buttons to turn the page. It is so lightweight and I love the option of the screen rotating whenI need to change hands. Awesome device! Was afraid to spend so much money for a kindle but so far I am glad I did. Love everything about it. The buttons to turns pages, screen resolution, lighting, how easy and light it is when you hold it. Case is beautiful. Enjoy reading on it. Great item! Would definitely recommend this item -- am still learning all the things about it. This product may be extremely overpriced, but it also lives up to everything it\\'s promised. It\\'s a lightweight, long-lasting ereader that is much easier on the eyes than an iPad. It is much lighter and more ergonomical than a paperback, and I find myself renting kindle copies of books I already own just to take advantage of the device\\'s convenience. Upgraded from my old Kindle keyboard. I love the ability to adjust brightness and font. I have small hands and this is not too big to hold in one hand. I was able to change the page turning buttons for left handed use. The charging cover last a long time. I wish there were more colors to choose from. This is not an upgrade by any means! My three year old kindle outperformed Oasis.Battery life better than a week with the lights on lowest setting Magnetic connector is poorly designed and grows weak Two pieces to keep up with; unsnaps constantly Amazon Customer Services promises it will resolved in an update Its a great ereader but a little pricy. It has the same specs as the Voyage as far as pixels and procesor, which costs less. The only difference between this and the Voyage, is that it\\'s much lighter, it\\'s brighter (LEDs), and a longer battery life if you\\'re using the cover. I\\'ve noticed the battery life drains much faster without the cover, but you\\'ll still be able to read for hours without it. You would think it be water resistant, hence the name but it isn\\'t. But then I don\\'t plan on reading when it\\'s raining or outside or while taking a bath. Overall, it\\'s the best ereader Amazon currently has to offer but if you don\\'t mind the price tag and want the best, then go for it! Voyage is still not a bad option though Great ebook for a beginner. Light and good looking I have had a Kindle for some time and was curious about the Oasis. It did not disappoint. It is very compact, even with the cover, and fits in a coat pocket. I really enjoy the size and the redesign which brings back hard buttons. Great device for home or on the go. Battery life is unreal! So much faster than my old kindle. This Kindle reader with cover attached is light weight and easy reading. Page turner is easy to use and it reverses so you can hold with either hand. I am very happy and satisfied with this product. Happy reading - The new design, compared to my old kindle paperwhite and voyage, looked weird when I first got my Kindle Oasis. After I used it for a while (5 hours), I felt the design was kind of make sense. When I hold it with one hand (right hand), the centre of gravity position was right in my hand, so there was less change that I drop the kindle on my face(when I was laying on my bed, it happened a lot with my kindle voyage) I\\'ve been a kindle owner since the early days and when new versions have come out in the past, it was usually a no-brainier to upgrade. The oasis was a little challenging because the price really makes you stop and think if this upgrade is worth it. After a lot of thought, the factor that convinced me to switch was the reappearance of the page turning buttons. I missed them since they vanished with the kindle keyboard! The paper white and the voyage were great devices but I often accidentally changed pages if I accidentally pinched the bezel when carrying the device or even just shifting positions on the couch. The Oasis\\' buttons have removed that issue and I am delighted! The weight and thinness of the device are also appreciated tho the paper white etc are pretty thin already. The addition of the cover is interesting but after a month\\'s use I think it\\'s pretty clear the cover/battery is there only to boost the very short-lived battery in the kindle itself. \"Months\" of battery life just seems impossible unless you keep the screen at low illumination and only read a few minutes a day. The screen is clear and bright, I can\\'t see any LED issues others have complained about and the interface does seem snappier than older versions. Ultimately the only real justification for buying this kindle is if you miss the page turn buttons and want to pay top dollar for them. Otherwise, the existing kindles will meet your needs. I would definitely buy it again, but it does not have the ambient light sensor like the cheaper voyage does to turn the brightness up and down automatically in the dark or sun. For a product of this price, it shouldn\\'t be missing any features. Otherwise it is great, light, and the text refreshes quickly and is crisp. Very nice Kindle with a great Battery life. My old kindle was not able to upgrade so I got the new Kindle and very pleased with the product. Arrived as promised from BESTBUY.COM. This is a great device. It is ultra light, and a pleasure to use. It also has a very satisfying premium feel. The price, of course, is not worth it.. unless you can afford it. There are cheaper models of the kindle with similar screen resolution....but if you CAN afford it, I highly recommend it. Th size difference is noticeable and squarish rather then rectangular, which I prefer. The Kindle unit itself is rather nice, the auto rotate and adjust being the best part. I returned this item b/c the cover is flimsy. and I was afraid I would drop it and break the kindle. lightweight and convenient to use. love my new kindle I purchased this as a gift for my wife and she loves it. She has an older Kindle, and she can\\'t believe how much better the Oasis is. Kindles are an excellent device for all book lovers Great for reading in the sunlight. As well as light, and easy on the wrist. Great product, but a little speedy. As a previous several Kindle device owner I read a lot of reviews, many of them put the Voyage above it for various reasons, mainly price, or battery charging. But, after reading the pros and cons of both I still decided the Oasis was the direction I wanted to go, I could always return it and get the Voyage after all if I didn\\'t like it. It\\'s light, very well lit, comfortable to hold both in the case and out of it. The buttons improve the page turning experience, I see no dark areas on my screed from the LED lights, it holds a great battery charge (true not as good as my previous Kindle, but I still generally get around 3 weeks between charges), and it looks absolutely beautiful. I am very happy with this purchases and am glad I purchased the Oasis over the Voyage. It\\'s expensive, and that\\'s the major con, but if you want the best reading device this is it and worth it if you read enough. New to eBooks and researched available eReaders and tablets. What I like best about the OASIS is the weight (lightest on the market), battery life (measured in weeks not hours) and the capability to use it in bright sunlight. Recommend it for all. I am a book addict and this is my 4th kindle device. This is by far the best one. It is so compact it is almost smaller than my large wallet. Can fit anywhere. Holds a charge incredibly well and very nice display to make reading fun. I read a lot and have loved my kindle paperwhite and used it all the time. I didn\\'t think it could get any better! I read all about the kindle Oasis and it sounded great but the price was freaking me out and I kept thinking I really didn\\'t need it! Well I finally talked myself into just trying it and after just taking it out of the box and holding it I was sold. It is so lightweight and so easy to hold and the screen is wonderful! The charging case is so convenient and so easy to take off and put on and it really looks nice. I never keep it on when I\\'m reading which keeps the kindle oasis light. I am so glad that I went for it and bought it. I want to read more than ever now. It is always in my purse. Believe me, I am not made of money in the least but I am so glad that I purchased this. If you are an avid reader you will be too! Excellent reader night or day, sunshine or shade. Not as full function as earlier kindels There\\'s no doubt that this is the best Kindle device available. The battery life is astonishing, and the design is unique and extremely ergonomic. Holding this in your hand is such a pleasurable experience, it fits like a glove. So what are the cons you may ask...For one, the battery life depends on the provided case. It acts like a travel charger in a sense. Why a con? Well, it limits your customization options. And there\\'s no way to purchase other colors or replacements for it at this time. So, you best be cautious with it.And two, the price obviously! But if you take into account that you basically are given a premium case, the device itself is a premium device, and you have a traveling charge inside the case...It may almost even out. But a $290-$350 device is hard to justify when it\\'s just for reading.Still would recommend to any fan of e-readers/reading Nice device. But only minimally better than the Voyage. \\'ve owned the Kindle Keyboard, 2nd generation Paperwhite and now the Oasis. I love the Oasis very much. The ergonomic design is wonderful and makes it a breeze to hold. It is so light -- that is the biggest killer feature of the Oasis. The 10 LEDs look fantastic and I love the return of page buttons. I\\'ve never had one where the screen is flush with the bezel so this is great. All in all, this is easily the best Kindle ever made and even though it\\'s a bit spendy, it will be the one future Kindles are measured against. I have had every kindle since the first and this is by far the best. The screen was already great on the Voyage but the front light on this screen is more white and more evenly distributed. Physical page turn buttons are so much better than none or the haptic feedback type. They didn\\'t include the automatically adaptive front light for some reason but I don\\'t think I\\'ll miss it much as I was always wont to fiddle with it on the Voyage anyway.But this device made me smile as soon as I held it for the first time because it has a larger bezel that you can really grip comfortably without touching the screen. Maybe this isn\\'t a big deal for most, but that is exactly why I spent the money to get this device.The other thing I was hoping for was the ability to use the upper page turn button to go forward and this device does that and even better because it is software configurable.The cover is very small and light and doesn\\'t add much bulk like the Voyage Origami case does. The only downside is that it doesn\\'t work as a hands free stand for reading.(I still wish it was waterproof) Despite not being able to get one of these from Amazon until late June due to apparent strong demand, Best Buy was able to get one to me on the day of its release, April 27. Well done Best Buy! Having owned several previous Kindles, including the most recent Paperwhite model, I was unprepared for how small and light this new Oasis model is -- reading about it is one thing, but actually holding one in your hand is something else entirely. The Oasis and its battery-charging cover together weigh only one ounce more than the latest Paperwhite with no case. The Oasis _without_ its cover feels impossibly light at 4.6 ounces. Size-wise, the Oasis is nearly a square shape at about 5\" wide by 5.5\" tall. In fact, the shape is so different from traditional Kindle designs that I had to compare it next to my Paperwhite to verify that the screens are actually the same size (they are). It\\'s the first Kindle I think I could easily fit into a jacket pocket without any effort, For frequent travelers like me, this is a key reason to buy one of these, as it\\'s extremely compact and easy to pack in a briefcase or purse. The screen is the first front-lit Kindle I\\'ve ever seen where you simply cannot see any trace of the LEDs from any angle. No dark spots, no bright spots...just a completely uniform illumination from edge to edge in both directions. The \"page\" also appears to be nearly flush with the top glass surface, helping achieve the illusion of printed paper. It\\'s sharp and clear, better than any Kindle I\\'ve used. The reader can be easily separated from the battery case by simply pulling them apart, since they are held together with magnets. After doing so, this is where the Amazon engineering team\\'s achievements really become clear, as you just won\\'t believe how lightweight this thing is. It\\'s easy to imagine holding onto it for hours without any arm fatigue, and switching from hand to hand is a simple matter of rotating it 180 degrees when switching. The display instantly rotates, and the page turn buttons also \"follow\", with the top button always used to advance the page, and the bottom button always used to go backward. You can also use the screen to change pages as you always have with earlier touch screen models. The battery on the reader has a lower capacity than the cover\\'s battery, so it runs down faster if you don\\'t have it connected to the case. It\\'s very easy to snap the reader back into its cover, which allows it to recharge while you continue to read. The power button and charge port are located in the upper top-right corner, more or less opposite from where they are on the Paperwhite. I find this location to be less awkward, as it\\'s easier to reach on the top than it is on the bottom edge. The back surface of the reader (not the case) seems to easily attract fingerprints, and they are not so easy to clean off. You\\'d think that Amazon would have figured out a way to prevent this by now. It\\'s a minor annoyance. Lots of reviewers in the tech press have complained loudly about this model\\'s high price relative to other Kindle models (without ads, it\\'s $310 vs. $139 for an ad-less Paperwhite). Is this a lot of money? Perhaps, but if you are a book addict and value an extremely lightweight reader that\\'s easy on both your arms and your eyes, then I personally think it\\'s worth it. A lot of thought and effort clearly went into designing and building this unit, and the price reflects that. Is it for everyone? Probably not, but there is obviously a market for it when you consider how many months you\\'ll have to wait to get one on Amazon\\'s website. If you are a serious reader, this device deserves a very close look -- I\\'m definitely keeping mine! I got oasis yesterday, very lighweight compared to voyager, screen size comparable, like having actual page turn button, touchscreen seems kinda slow, the on/off button on top is improvement from back of voyager. cover does seem kind of flimsy, but supposed to be leather so will see how it holds up. finding it easier to hold with cover on, then removed. cover doesn\\'t have separate charge port, so all charging is done thru kindle. BestBuy delivered this on the day of release. Amazon still seems to be back-ordered. It is a great product. Nice and light with uniform screen and snappy performance. Got this for my wife and she loves it. Compact library on the go for an avid reader. Kindle Oasis is phenomenal... It is portable size so it fits almost anywhere when I travel, the book-like screen doesn\\'t bother my eyes after long periods of time of reading, I can modify the font and size to my wants and needs, you can conveniently connect to your Goodreads account to view your bookshelves and all of my purchases sync perfectly. The color Merlot is beautiful and I\\'ve had it for three months and traveled with it and there have been no damages. The battery life is so long I have only charged it three times since owning it and I read anywhere from 3-5 hours a day. Completely user friendly. Small, light, but comfortable to hold with either hand. If you keep it in airplane mode with medium lighting, the battery last for weeks. Lovin\\' it so far. Would give it a 5 star if the battery lasted as long as they claim. But it\\'s worth the extra charging times for the nice design. So light and easy in your hand especially without the cover. But, using the cover is comfortable as well. The leather cover smells a bit when it arrives but I let it air out for a few days before using it and now it\\'s fine. Nice quality leather and I love the merlot color. The page turn buttons are easier to use than the buttons on the voyage. Screen looks the same even though they claim there are more backlights on this one. I\\'m very happy with my Oasis. Almost feels like reading a book in a light comforting way. Easy to carry around. Great on eyes and reading is enjoyable When they first announced the Kindle Oasis, I did not have much of a desire to upgrade from my 1st generation Kindle Paperwhite. Just as I felt when they announced the Voyage.I read a lot, so my Kindle travels with me throughout the day most of the time. I have never had an issue with battery life, I have only had it get really low a few times (typically when I was traveling). So again, I originally did not see a lot of the value to the Oasis.As the reviews for the Oasis came out, I started to realize what I did not like about my Paperwhite, and I began to have an interest in upgrading my Paperwhite to the either the Oasis or possibly the Voyage. The main thing I noticed is that I took my Paperwhite out of the Amazon case quite a lot, especially when I was in a seated position. This slight reduction in weight made it much more comfortable to hold for longer reading sessions. I had some other minor issues with my Paperwhite, like when reading in the dark, I couldn\\'t find an adjustment for the light that I preferred (5 was a little too dim and 6 was a brighter than I needed). I decided to pass on the Voyage because I really did not like the case options and the pressure sensitive page turn option.Now that I have the Oasis, I definitely think it was worth it for me. I really appreciate the reduced weight when the cover is off (not to mention the ease of removing the cover compared to the Paperwhite). It provides the same reading experience, although I did get a resolution upgrade compared to my older Paperwhite, which is a plus.The Oasis is really comfortable in my hand, which helps me forget that it is there. When I was holding my Paperwhite with my left hand, at times I would accidentally go back a page, which drove me crazy even though its just a minor inconvenience.I have the black model because it was the only option available unless I was willing to wait a few more months. The build quality of the Oasis and its case is very nice, just like with the Paperwhite and the amazon leather case for it. The only concern I have is how well it will protect the Kindle. I will update the review if I find this to be a problem.I loved my Paperwhite, and I will recommend it to anyone looking to upgrade from an older Kindle or buying one for the first time. It definitely is great and the better buy, but I am glad I decided to order the Oasis. The reduced weight, ergonomic design, and page turn buttons make it worth the added cost. I bought 2 and am returning them both. Both had lighting issues. On the first one, one half of the screen had a white/blue tint and the other half was more of a yellow tint. When i flipped the device upside down to rotate to use with my other hand, half of the screen went much darker than the other. I returned it because I had read there were some that had lighting issues and bought another one. My second one was worse. You could see little half moons going down one side. That one also had a much yellower tint overall than the first one.I found it not easy to hold unless it was in the charging case. It was too slippery and, weird to say, small for me. I\\'m a female with average sized hands.I think what I really did love was the charging case and the size for transport purposes. Maybe when they make a few tweaks and lower the price I might try again. With the cover attached, the battery lasts for a good, long period. With the cover detached (which is how I use it primarily), the Oasis is so thin that it is almost weightless in your hand. The ability to switch hands (flip upside down) means one never seems to tire of holding the device to read a book; and, it fits into my pants pocket, again, perfect for traveling. The battery seems to last with heavy usage for at least several days, but I tend to reconnect the cover at night (I am assuming that helps to recharge the basic Oasis battery). Regardless, it was well worth replacing our older Kindle readers with the newer Oasis (we bought two). Easy to carry in purse or pocket but doesn\\'t do anything better than the cheapest Kindle reader. I debated buying the new Kindle Oasis, since I\\'ve owned every Kindle since the first release. It was worth the money, as the form factor is the best yet... it\\'s comfortable to hold in one hand, and the text is crisp and easy to read. Even when I’m outside in bright sunlight, the words of the book I’m reading are still crystal clear. That alone makes the Kindle Oasis worth what it cost me.The Kindle Oasis wakes up in just seconds, and any book I choose instantly opens, ready to be read.It is the perfect size and isn’t heavy or bulky. I really do read for hours at a time. Sometimes I pace the floor while I read. Sometimes I’m on my elliptical machine when I read. And sometimes I’m sitting down. No matter what I’m doing, the Kindle Oasis remains comfortable to hold, and it is always easy on my eyes.When I receive a book that is in PDF, most of the time I can enlarge the words. If it won’t allow me to enlarge the words, I can change the orientation of the page and the words are automatically larger. I am able to make notes on the book if needed, and I can highlight words and/or passages.My merlot leather cover is attractive. When I flip it open, it is just like opening the cover of a book.How to Make the Battery LastOn the Kindle Oasis page, it says that its “dual-battery charging system delivers months of battery life.” This was a huge thing for me. Instead of having to charge my tablet almost every day, I would be able to read for months without charging the Kindle!Is this how my Oasis has performed? Well, not so much. There are conditions that have to be met for the charge on your Oasis to last for two months.First, you have to limit your reading to thirty minutes a day. That one is impossible for me. There are days that I am only able to read for thirty minutes, but they don’t occur very often. My Kindle goes everywhere with me, and I use just about every spare moment to read.Second, the wireless needs to be turned off. That one is easy to do but not always easy to remember. The only time the wireless needs to be on is to download one or more books.Third, this is based on your light setting at 10. That is way too low for me. I keep my light setting anywhere from 16 to 18.I don’t limit my reading to thirty minutes a day, and I try to remember to keep my wireless turned off. My light setting is kept anywhere from 16 to 18, and I put my Kindle to sleep the second I’m done reading. So how long does a single charge last me? Ten days is the longest a charge has lasted me so far, but it would have kept a charge for several more days if I had remembered to turn my wireless off. Once I succeed in keeping my wireless off, I will let you know how long the charge lasts.Now, I don’t plug it in to charge as soon as the charge on the cover gets low. I allow my cover charge to go as low as it will possibly go and then the Kindle battery will start to drain since it can no longer charge from the cover. I allow it to drain down to about 50% before I plug the cover and Kindle into my computer to charge.The one thing that surprised me was that everything on the Oasis is in black and white. For some reason, I thought that maybe the book covers would appear in color. But since I bought the Oasis to read books on, color isn’t needed.Special offers do appear on my screen but only when my Kindle is going to sleep or waking up. They aren’t a distraction, and to be honest, they are kind of fun to look at. You can pay a higher price so they won’t appear on your Kindle if you would rather not see them.I asked myself some questions once I had my Kindle and knew just how it worked. If I had known before I bought my Kindle Oasis that the charge wouldn’t last for months, would I still have bought it? Yes, I would have. If I had known that everything would appear in black and white, would I still have bought it? Yes, I would have. Easy to handle. Light weight. I like that it automatically shuts off when the cover is closed. Bought for my wife to upgrade from the original Kindle that she has worn out. Big step up from the original and should be good for another 8-10 years. I love the snap on cover that charges the kindle. It is also very light. Wife love it, reads a lot and this is her go to reader. This is my third Kindle. The best differentiator is the form factor. Definite improvement over the paperwhite. Also like having the page-turn buttons back. Case is very cool indeed. If you can get past the jump in price (remember you\\'re not having to buy the case separately), it\\'s a quality product to have. I was so looking forward to this that I bought it right when it popped up as available on Best Buy. This is obviously the most refined Kindle on the market as of now. The ergonomics are just perfect, as there is no other Kindle or any ebook reader for that matter that is as easy to use single handed as this one. Fits perfectly in the palm and the page turn buttons are a joy to use.The charging case can be removed while reading and it snaps back easily, you do not have to deliberately align it properly. Once the case is connected it starts charging the Kindle which prolongs its battery life.In short, if you are an avid reader and can spare $290, this is the Kindle to buy. For occasional readers it might not make sense to spend so much and the Kindle Paperwhite should do just fine. I have used Kindle e-readers since Amazon introduced them years ago. All are good products and each new model has been a worthwhile upgrade. The Oasis is no exception, even from the highly touted Voyage model. It is expensive but the lightweight design, improved backlighting and battery cover are worth the additional expense for someone who reads frequently. This is definitely a good investment! This is my 4th kindle and is easily the best one I\\'ve ever had. It is very comfortable to hold and is very compact. I was surprised how small it is but has the same screen size as my other kindles. It may look costly at first but remember you are getting a cover with additional battery. This is the best kindle ereader yet. The size and weight make it perfect for comfortable reading. You will find yourself reading more books than ever with it. Actually easier to hold than a paperback, and might even be lighter! Finally received the Kindle Lighted Leather Cover for the newest version Kindle. It is VERY lightweight and I had to double and triple check the description considering it states this is a leather cover. The front cover is very thin with a medium-weight cardboard feel to it. The leather on the front cover is extremely thin and you can immediately tell the surface will be easily scratched and marred with normal everyday use. The inside of the front cover has a thin microfiber material to protect the screen. The back cover is hollowed out plastic to form-fit your Kindle and snaps in with relative ease.Using the enclosed graphic instruction card, I removed the Kindle as shown, having to use just enough pressure to make me a bit concerned for someone who would place and remove their Kindle in this cover frequently. However, I plan on using this cover as a full-time solution for both protection and as a light source.I went ahead and pulled up a book and switched the light on, heading to a closet to see how this looked in complete darkness. The light pulls out of the back cover and is nice and stiff and has a locked full-out position. The spread of the light is greater on top obviously but it does reach the entire screen on the Kindle. There was no glare or reflection and I was able to easily read the page without any noticeable straining.If I were to choose between this design and the Kindle Keyboard lighted cover, which I have used since its release, I would choose this newer cover.Read more I owned a Kindle Keyboard for about a year, and I purchased the leather lighted case for that unit. While the corner light left a little to be desired as far as even lighting, overall I was very pleased with the case. Based on that experience, I went ahead and purchased the lighted cover for my new Kindle. I can\\'t say this experience has as been as positive.Let\\'s start off with what\\'s good about the case. The Kindle battery powered light is a big improvement. The light is now centered on the screen, so illumination is more even now. I don\\'t use the light often, but in the cases where I do it will be nice to have more balanced coverage. One positive on the case itself is that I appreciate how much lighter this one feels than the previous generation. The hinge area is smaller, which means less of the spine folding effect the other one took on after heavy use. I never took my Kindle Keyboard out of the case after it was put in, so the snug fit I have seen complaints about is not an issue for me. It IS tight, though, so if you don\\'t plan to keep the case on full time be aware it may take some effort to get it back out. In my situation, that tight fit is exactly what I want, but your mileage may vary.Now on to the negatives. The case does feel very cheap, especially with no change in price point. The previous cover felt like a solidly made piece of work, whereas the new cover only feels half as sturdy. The thinness of the case was no doubt done to minimize its weight, so I realize this is a personal issue. Outside the thickness, though, it just doesn\\'t look or feel as well made. The textured surface of the previous model you that leather feel, very much like a real book. Finally, the most stunning oversight is the lack of a closure device.Read more I purchased this Kindle case in the Saddle Tan color. The leather is high quality (it has that wonderful new smell as well) and has beautiful stitching around the border on the front. The case does not add any bulk to the Kindle. I find it quite comfortable to hold in one hand or two, as the front cover folds behind the case, and I truly feel like I am holding an actual book while reading.At the top of the case, there is a plastic arm that pulls upward to reveal a light, which illuminates the screen of the Kindle perfectly in a dark room. My eyes have no trouble reading with the light activated. The light is powered by the Kindle itself, by way of two metal prongs inside the case making contact with two metal tabs on the lower back of the Kindle. The arm for the light does seem a bit delicate, and I could see a young child inadvertently breaking this if care is not shown. I fear that over time, this will be the first piece to stop functioning as the case is regularly used.My only criticism of this case is that there is no way to secure the front cover from opening. It would have been nice to include a clasp, or some kind of stretchable band to keep the case closed. I paid 54 for this case, which is almost as expensive as the Kindle itself. At that price, the designers should have had the forethought to include a means of securing the case from opening. Aside from this potential problem, this Kindle case is perfect, and adds a bit of sophistication to an already awesome device.Kudos, Amazon! I have had the Kindle Keyboard with it\\'s lighted cover and now I have the new Kindle with lighted cover. I will briefly compare them and then list the pros and cons of this cover.In comparison:-The kindle keyboard in the cover is much heavier than the new kindle in it\\'s cover. The new case does a much better job of securing the kindle as well, it is no longer hinged only on one edge, but instead it is form fit inside of a rigid rubber shell that attaches to the back of the new kindle-The lighting is about the same between both cases, but where the old case lit the screen from the top right corner, the new case lights the screen from the top middle.-I feel like the old light mechanism was more durable. The light bar on this cover is made out of very stiff, thin plastic instead of the thick rubbery plastic that contained the light on the old cover. It also hinges open instead of pulling out of the case, and the hinge feels subpar.-The light on the new case is less angled and tends to get in my eyes more when reading than the old kindle keyboard case did.All in all I still like the new case. It fits the new kindle very well and does not increase the size or weight very much. The leather is somewhat thin but not horribly so and it looks sleek on the kindle. I will be keeping this case.Pros:Compact case that looks very sleekTight and secure fitUses the Kindle\\'s batteries so no additional power is needed.Provides adequate lighting across the entire screen.Cons:Lightbar hinge seems very cheap.Since I only received this today, I cannot yet evaluate the additional drain that this case will place on the Kindle\\'s battery.Read more I read every single review for this cover before I decided to buy it, but I am glad that I finally decided to pull the trigger. I have never had a Kindle or another cover, so my review is based on a first-timer\\'s perspective. This is my feedback:1) I agree that this cover is expensive. Ridiculously expensive. But, after pricing other covers and other lights, then factoring in that I would have to buy replacement batteries for any other light, it did not seem like I would be saving much money if I bought something else. Plus, the fact that the light is built-in was very appealing and turns out to be extremely convenient.2) Yes, the cover should have had a magnet or something for closure. That was the main reason for my initial hesitation, not the price. I thought about using a rubber band around it, but some people mentioned that a rubber band would look ugly around the pretty cover (which, by the way, is quite pretty in the wine purple color). I ended up knitting a small little sleeve to slip over my Kindle cover to keep the cover closed, for additional protection, and to prevent scratches, because:3) The cover does scratch quite easily. I agree with one reviewer who did not seem to mind the scratches on the cover, because doesn\\'t that show that the cover is doing its job to protect the Kindle But, it does sound like the same cover for the Kindle Keyboard was much more durable. It would be nice for the cover to keep looking fresh and new, but I would rather my Kindle be protected than for my cover to look perfect. My little knitted sleeve is helping with that, but I know a lot of people wouldn\\'t want to use an additional cover.4) Some people commented that the cover added too much to the size and weight of the Kindle. ReallyRead more The Kindle is my first e-ink reader. I own an iPad, an iPhone, and have owned a Windows-based phone in the past that I used as an ereader.My overall impression of the device is good.The good:I\\'d honestly rather read linear (read from page one to the end, one page at a time) fiction from it than a book, because I can\\'t always get comfortable with a book. Hardcovers are sometimes a bit heavy, and paperbacks don\\'t always lie open easily. The Kindle is incredibly light and thin. I can hold it in one hand easily. The page turn buttons are conveniently located. Page-turns aren\\'t instant, but they\\'re probably quicker than turning a physical page in a printed book (there are just a lot more page-turns unless you choose a small font). The contrast is better than other ereaders I\\'ve seen. There is zero eye strain in good light. My eyesight isn\\'t the greatest and I like being able to increase the font size and read without glasses. I love being able to browse the Kindle store and read samples before deciding to purchase. The experimental browser is surprisingly usable, but isn\\'t great. It is useful for browsing wikipedia and blogs.

There are newer models: the basic, cheapie Kindle and the Kindle Touch, and of course the Kindle Fire quasi-tablet.Each of these models is an excellent choice. Whichever one is right for you just depends on your preferences.The 3 e-ink Kindles are Kindle Keyboard (this one), Kindle Touch (the newest flagship model), and the basic Kindle. All 3 of them have EXACTLY THE SAME 6 DISPLAY, with the same sharp typeface and high contrast that reads like ink on paper with no eyestrain. The Kindle Keyboard is the oldest of these models, and I got one of the first ones when they came out in August 2010.I still absolutely LOVE my Kindle Keyboard and use it almost every day. I have read dozens of books on it. I like the newer models, they have some neat features, but the experience of reading a book on them is no better or worse than on my 1-year-old Kindle Keyboard. Page turns are now smoother and faster on the newest Kindles, but the difference is not enough to make it worth the cost of upgrading, in my opinion.The touch-screen interface of the Kindle Touch is pretty neat. But, unlike my iPad, I only use my Kindle to read books, and reading books is just as nice on any of the current Kindle models. I don\\'t consider the touch screen a must have feature, and I\\'m normally obsessed with having the latest version of every tech product I own.For that reason, I think the cheapest Kindle is an excellent choice.Read more I\\'m a first-time Kindle owner, so I have nothing to compare the latest Kindle to.

I have an iPad and a Kindle DX, but I guess someone heard my complaints of them being too heavy and difficult to do extended-reading on. Don\\'t get me wrong, I absolutely love my iPad and DX, but this new generation of Kindle is perfect for reading outside and for long periods of time. The iPad gets completely washed out in sunlight and often irritates my eyes staring at it for more than a couple of hours. The DX was my go-to device for those extended/outdoor reading periods, but now I have a new friend for reading novels. Instead of a replacement, this one seems more like a companion to the other devices and is a different class. The iPad works great for web browsing, shopping, productivity, games, etc while the Kindle falls short in those areas. The Kindle works great for reading novels, where the iPad falls short. For those that love to do extended-reading of magazines, newspapers, research articles, etc, I find that the DX is the go-to device.Without a doubt, the size and weight of the new kindle is the biggest draw for me. It\\'s smaller than the last edition by a significant margin. I\\'ve played around with the Kindle 2 and was impressed, but now looking at the size of the new Kindle, I\\'m blown away. It\\'s the absolute perfect size. Smaller would be unmanageable and larger wouldn\\'t feel nearly as good. This is a device that you can hold up, read, and just forget that it\\'s there.

All of them quit working. There\\'s absolutely no way to revive them once that battery loses power If NOT charged immediately, if even just a few weeks go by, NO HOPE of ever using your Kindle again. A major flaw I recently ordered my 8th Kindle. It was to replace my 7th Kindle which I unknowingly crushed. I love the Kindle Keyboard as my clumsy old hands tremble too much to type on a touch screen. For me, newer is just more frustrating. However, new Keyboard Kindles are scarce on the ground, so I got a reconditioned one. I noticed on my account page that Amazon recognized my new Kindle as soon as I bought it. When it arrived, however, it was not registered to me and it claimed it could not connect to my home WiFi. So I called my internet provider. I waded through that companys automated menu beginning with press 1 for English. That irritates me as I think English should be the default language in this country. But pressing on, I provided my 9 digit phone number, my 10 digit account number, my 9 digit zip code, my address, my 8 digit birthday, and the name of my favorite pet, my first car and my oldest nephew. Then I listened to an automated menu that had a 9 item selection none of which exactly fitted the problem I was having. After all this, I was asked if I would provide feedback after the call. I know this company and I was sure I would have comments to make, so I pressed 1 for yes. Then instead of finally letting me speak to a person, the automated voice directed me back through the forest of numbers I had already provided. Patiently I retyped all I had already typed. This time I was cannier. I refused the opportunity to give feedback and was finally connected to a person a person with a strong foreign accent and a bad phone connection. Didnt I press 1 for English After struggling for several minutes I begged for a supervisor as I could not understand the English spoken by this person. I was eventually routed to three other people with a hold time between each new connection as each person I spoke to did not handle my problem. I asked for phone numbers every time so I could reconnect if my call was disconnected accidentally. Finally I found a person who could help and did indeed get a connection established between my Kindle and my WiFi. I again asked for a telephone number in case I had further problems. Im sorry. I do not have a phone number that you can call to connect directly to me. Well, I should have known. I had been on the phone for 50 minutes.Then my Kindle would not download my archived items. So I contacted Amazons Help Line. I got an American in the first minute. I did not have to press anything I explained my problem. The Amazon American fiddled with a few buttons on his end and my Kindle began working correctly. I was on the phone for 4 minutes. Great. Love it. I researched the purchase of a Kindle for a long time. I couldn\\'t decide whether or not it was worth buying a dedicated e-reader. Boy am I glad I made this purchase. The downside to Amazon\\'s online selling of Kindle 3 is that the customers don\\'t get to see it in person. It is much better in person. This may sound stupid, but when I got my new Kindle, I thought there was a stuck-on overlay on the screen containing a diagram of the unit\\'s buttons, etc. I actually tried to peel it off. Doh! The e-ink on this unit is THAT good. I didn\\'t realize that I was staring at the actual display. I also didn\\'t realize that no power is required until the display changes. (thus the great battery life) I do a lot of reading, but was facing the prospect of reading less or buying large type books because of my variable and deteriorating eyesight. The new Kindle has been a godsend. Now, I can decide the size of type I need depending on my level of fatigue among other things. The weight and ergonomics are very good. For someone, like me, with neuropathy in his hands, it is extremely easy to manage and enjoyable to own. To me, it is easier to read than print books. The ease of navigation is great as is the speed. The battery life, so far, has been extraordinary. It easily connected to our home Wi-Fi, which by design does not broadcast an SSID. It downloads books so fast that I almost thought they were not completely received. I did not buy the 3G version because of the price difference and the fact that there is no coverage where I live. If you are not constantly traveling, I don\\'t see the need to spend the extra bucks, but that is a matter of personal choice. For those who have no Wi-Fi at home, remember that you can always download the material to your computer and transfer it via USB.Read more This thing has captured my wife\\'s heart. She reads every where, all the time. Vacation, on the way to church, At bedtime and far beyond. Books are so easy to get from the kindle itself It fits in her purse, I have to repeat everything , I always get, right after this chapter . Do not buy this for someone you want share LIFE with. I got my Kindle a few years ago and barely used it. Recently I discovered it again and have been using it daily, always in a hard protective case as it has been from day 1. Yesterday I opened the cover ready to read and discovered the screen had apparently cracked, seemingly for no apparent reason (no extreme temperatures, dropping, pressure, etc.). A quick Google search revealed this is a common problem, especially for my model, which made me think Amazon would replace the device for me due to the obvious design flaw. Not a chance though. Despite endless reports of this problem popping up through simple internet searches the representative I spoke to denied this was a common problem and was only able to offer me a very slight discount on a new product. Not sure it is worth the investment again - thinking it is better to stick to reading on my iPad, which is equipped with indestructible Gorilla Glass. Bottom line: do not buy a Kindle if you want a lasting product It was excellent for me in one moment when I was able to use it onboard cruise ship while ship was in international water with it\\'s own 3G or EDGE cellphone network. Once they stop this way of using around 5 months ago, now I can use it only when I am in the states. Bought for my husband for Christmas and I have to admit that I use it much more than he does, I love this product even though it has been updated with newer versions. I like to have something with just books. Easy to use, screen is easy to read, battery life long. I use it at the beach and for travel. Nice to have It simply works even after 3.5 years of constant use. The battery is OK. Display looks the same. System is stable and reasonably responsive. I would highly recommend them to everyone. Got it when I was told that I would get it. Very happy. Through all of my research this was the best value for what I was looking for in an e-reader with additional options I was not sure I would use or not. Turns I do because of the ease of usage. Pretty decent tablet. Good for mindless games and Netflix. You get what you pay for. Much more memory that my prior kindles. Luv that I can add a sd card for extra storage good quality, low cost compare to iPad, i like this. I was going to have to be face down after eye surgery recently and decided to get a tablet to be able to look at the internet and movies on something other than my phone. While there are ones which have more features (and better software), the Fire HD8 had a good price and was available. It had gotten good reviews, and it performs well, with great battery life. If you\\'re looking for a good, basic tablet, this is a nice option. I love the tablets HD picture is beautiful. The fire tablet is very fast to load and is easy to use. Great tablet. This is very nice for a little over 100.00 dollars. It took a bit to get use to after using a iPad. I got this to travel with or take to the beach nice size very lightweight. I couldn\\'t get the tablet to work with my WiFi so I returned it and bought a Samsung A-8. This tablet is small, compact and easy to handle. It\\'s easy to figure out the main functions. My one complaint is that it does not support some big apps such as Dropbox or Google Drive. I\\'m a Windows person & this is not Windows. I\\'m still learning. I am happy with the size as it fits easily in to my purse, but I HATE touch items - I always seem to touch the wrong area (like spelling something, I go for a letter & get one of the letters next to - so it slows down my typing - one of the reasons I don\\'t have a smartphone). All in all it\\'s pretty good. I guess I would recommend it because it\\'s the way this world is turning. However, they don\\'t make a glass protective screen cover - only plastic. Ordered for my daughter to replace an older version and she loves it. Larger screen and colored case are a big plus. I have not set up tablet, geeks squad to do so Monday April 3 2017 Have been using this for a while and never believe it would be so handy and helpful. Product features are good and is quite handy to carry anywhere. I love the internet, tweeting and facebook. No computers can complete me!! My kindle takes care of all my needs ;) !!!Juju I like it. It keeps my granddaughter business and great apps too. She loves it, the only problem I have is getting it away from her, even while riding in vehicles. LOL I bought this because I have ebooks in college. Not only could I not get my ebook. I called the school IT department. They could not either. My semester was already started. The sales representative at the store told me this is what I needed. I ended up buying a tablet from my phone carrier and my ebooks were right there in less than 5 minutes with the schools IT department help. Wife really likes it. Works great& likes the front & back camera. I bought this kindle for my 11yr old granddaughter for Christmas. Me and my husband both had kindles several years prior, and she and my 6 year old grandson love watching and playing on them. Both children have all kinds of game systems but use the kindle way more. My 6 yr old grandson still plays with mine and loves watching you tube, videos and playing games on it. He has several game systems, Xbox, sega, ds but still uses my kindle all the time over those systems.my husband used his all the time for everything from internet to watching movies and shows. I\\'m getting ready to buy my grandson a new kindle( mine is a bit older and has cracked screen now but still works good).He would like one to call his own. I\\'m looking at a 16 GB or 32 GB.they are really durable and tough. This is my first Fire Kindle. I love it. It is fast, and has good internet. It gives me quick access to all my Kindle library. I found out it\\'s easier to scroll through the pages than when using Kindle Touch. Fast on internet, easy connection. Easy to use. Clear display. Was looking at iPad mini. After reading reviews of both Kindle fire and iPad I bought the Kindle for so much less $$$ And I don\\'t have to put up the Apple\\'s native apps etc. Thanks. We really like this tablet . It\\'s easy to use All I wanted was a Kindle to read books. I got this instead!! Excellent choice because I can read books and do so much more!! I had to return this product as it was not compatible with things such as Facebook and Itunes... which is what I needed it for. Great if you are into books and streaming movies! Love this Kindle. There are to many apps and games offered for download. Love the book selection Easy to navigate The charger seems a bit loose, though I like the ease of use and good support from Amazon. A reasonable price for a versatile tablet. This tablet is excellent considering the price. It has a very clear display, is a fairly large tablet, and has plenty of memory to store a lot of apps, music, pictures and more. Considering the price, this tablet has the best value out of all tablets to date in my opinion. I\\'ve had lots of tablets in the past, mostly from the Samsung line, but this is my first Amazon Fire, so I want to write this review for others who have never tried one of these. At the time that this was written, Alexa had not been added to the tablet.First, while this device runs an Android type of operating system, Amazon puts its own spin on the operating system. I don\\'t feel like I\\'m using Android. This feels different to me. It doesn\\'t have the same level of customization that Android users have come to appreciate. That being said, if you are an Amazon Prime member, this device has been tailored to be your content entertainment machine. It\\'s simply a fun way to consume your magazines, books, etc.There are 3 on-screen buttons on the bottom of the device. The middle button immediately takes you to your home screen. The button to the left acts as a sort of \"back\" button. It also lets me get rid of my keyboard when I don\\'t need it on screen, but it\\'s open. The button to the right is super important. It took me a couple of days to realize what it does. That square shaped button is what you press you see what apps you have open. It lets you switch between apps, but it also lets you see which apps you have open and close them out. You can close them by pressing the \"X\" button in the corner of the window that appears or by touching the app window and swiping to the right. If you leave all of those apps open and you never close them, you\\'ll drain your battery. Make sure you use that little square button to clear your apps.The device has several menus that you swipe left to view. First, you start with your home screen. You literally can stay on this screen and do anything you need to do on the tablet. All of your apps are housed here. You swipe up to view all of them. The tablet comes with several apps pre-installed such as Slik, Amazon\\'s own internet browser, Audible, Good Reads, the Amazon app store, a weather app, etc. You can go to the Amazon app store to download other apps such as Twitter, Facebook, etc. You can combine the apps on this page into folders. You just drag one app to another app and a folder appears. This made my home screen much more manageable. You can change the size of the font on the home screen from normal to large or small in the device settings. This feature doesn\\'t necessarily increase the size of the font within your apps, however. I believe it only changes the font on your main screens.If you have a magazine or newspaper subscription that is connected to your device, when you have a new issues, it will show up at the top of your home page screen under the heading of \"new items.\" The device comes with a free 6 month subscription to the Washington Post. You\\'ll see that under \"new items\" when you initially activate your tablet.You can change the wallpaper on the screen to use one of your own photos. You can do this through the settings menu on the device. If you want to use one of your own photos, however, you need to either take it on the device or move it into Amazon\\'s Photos app, which is a cloud-based app.So far, I haven\\'t found a way to effectively use a different photo management app that will let me change my wallpaper. I\\'m not crazy about the Amazon Photo app. I found it annoying to move my photos from my phone into Amazon\\'s cloud just so I could view them on my tablet. That being said, I\\'m not planning to take photos on this device. I just wanted a few pet photos on there and the ability to change my wallpaper.Beyond the home screen, you can swipe to the right to view your other screen. They are pre-arranged to be: books, videos, games, shop, apps, music, audiobooks, and newstand. All of those screens are connected to your Amazon account. For example, if you have Kindle books you\\'ve already purchased, they automatically will appear under the Books menu. Your magazines and newspaper subscriptions will appear under the newstand menu. There doesn\\'t seem to be a way to change the order of the menu pages. That bugs me, but it\\'s not the end of the world. There\\'s also one menu to the left of the \"home\" menu. It\\'s the \"recent\" page. It shows you what you\\'ve received looked at on the tablet. I never use it, but it might be handy for some people.One of my favorite features of this tablet is Amazon\\'s \"On Deck\" capability. If you\\'re an Amazon Prime member, Amazon will periodically download a video to your device that it thinks you might like. The items don\\'t count against your pre-installed memory and they automatically deleted off if your memory starts getting full. You can turn off the \"on deck\" feature if you don\\'t like it. I\\'ve been content with the video playback capability. This isn\\'t my major use of the device, but the images look fine and the audio is OK. I\\'ll talk more about the speakers later. My other favorite feature of this tablet is viewing magazine content through the Newstand. I\\'ve tried 3 magazines on here and they all look gorgeous. Now, I can always have my magazines with me so if I\\'m stuck at the airport or at the doctor\\'s office, I always have them. One of my regular magazines includes a free digital version of the magazine for free. I just had to connect my account to the device. This allows me to download the back issues of the magazine for as long as I\\'ve had an account. My other magazine didn\\'t include a digital edition so I canceled the print edition of it and switched to the digital version. (It was an inexpensive magazine, anyway.) There are several magazines that you can try free for 30 days on the device. I did this with a third magazine and decided to keep it for a year. Viewing magazines on this gadget is a pleasure.The Kindle Fire doesn\\'t come with the Google Play store installed. You can side load it to the device without rooting it (and breaking your warranty.) You can Google to find the instructions to do this. It\\'s not difficult to do if you\\'re fairly comfortable with technology. It probably took me 10 minutes. Most of the apps I wanted were in the Amazon store, but there were a handful that I had paid for through Google Play. The only way I could have them was to go back to access that store. They have worked fine so far. I despise the keyboard that Amazon pre-installed on this device. There are no lines between the letters on the keyboard. I suppose it designed to be better for swyping through keys, but I hate it. I fixed that problem by going to Google Play and downloading a new keyboard. It was a pretty easy problem to solve so I can\\'t complain.Apps that are connecting to the Internet can be a little slow to load on this device compared to my other gadgets, but that generally doesn\\'t bother me. If you were using this tablet to replace your personal laptop, however, that might drive you crazy. The screen on this device isn\\'t bad. If I compare it to my fancy phone, it\\'s not as shape, but when you think about the price of this device compared to my smartphone, the screen is outstanding.The speakers are OK. There are two of them located on the bottom of the screen. I won\\'t say that they are fantastic. They aren\\'t. In my opinion, they are fine for watching YouTube or a television show. They are not OK for listening to music if you are an audiophile. You can make it a little better by downloading a different music app instead of relying on the pre-install app, but still your music will sound tinny. That being said, you can always connect your tablet to a bluetooth speaker, use a pair of headphones, etc.This device wasn\\'t made for taking pictures. It has a front and back camera, but they aren\\'t designed to be spectacular. I\\'m not using them.I find this device a little difficult to hold in my hands. I think that\\'s partly because of the size and partly because it feels very slick. Also, I do have some hand problems (similar to someone who has Carpal Tunnel syndrome). I think it will be easier to handle once my case arrives. I\\'m still waiting for it. I\\'m greatly enjoying this device. It\\'s simply fun to use the tablet. There are weaknesses that come with that lower price tag, but you legitimately get a lot of bang for your buck, particularly if you regularly use Amazon services. If you don\\'t typically use Amazon and you are just looking for a tablet for viewing the Internet and you\\'re looking for a low price tag, this device may be OK for you. I bought this to replace a damaged much more expensive tablet of my daughters. Great item and just as nice as the more expensive one. She absolutely loves it. Fantastic tablet fire one is great. Small and portable I purchased this product with an eye on simply trying out a tablet. It has become a product I use every day. You have to get used to the Amazon app store, which is different than the Google Play store, though it is still android-based. The tablet is fast and the user experience is satisfying. I purchased the 32Gb. model for the extra storage space. It is a great tablet for under $100! Decent little tablet if you are not a game player. Tablet shuts down and I cant get it back on when I play games for long periods of time. It\\'s not my ipad, that\\'s for sure. Does a lot more than old tablet.It Hasmore memory. Excellent value, lets me lug all my favorite books around and read whenever. Wouldn\\'t be without it. I love my Amazon Fire HD 8. It\\'s not too small and not too big. I was looking at other tablets, and decided on the Amazon Fire HD 8 because of the price, and because I have Amazon Prime, I purchased it online at Best Buy, and then picked it up at the store on Black Friday. It is my first tablet, and so I wanted to start with one that I can have fun with, and I am. I do have a laptop for important things. I have put off buying a tablet because all the ipads I tried with friends were hypersensitive making it difficult for me to navigate easily. This one is the bomb - I am 68 and not a techie but quite intelligent - this Kindle Fire is a perfect fit for me and does everything I want it to do and more with great speed and wonderful resolution. I am new at tablets and look forward to enjoying learning all that this Kindle Fire will provide for me - so far each step has been a breeze. I just love it. my daughter just loved this kindle fire. she said it was the perfect gift that she could receive. I love my kindle fire. Its a great reading device. Easy to set up, great picture love it! Keeps my kids entertained and they love it also ....it was a gift. The last 2 models of Kindle HDX 8 have been terrible. We have purchased 2 of each model of Kindle and up until the last 2 models, they have been great. Last years had to be replaced 7 or 8 times and for the same problem. The slot for the SD card is defective. I gave up and bought the newest model. It shuts completely down if you try to plug it in to external speakers and sometimes it shuts down for no reason. It\\'s going back after the first of the year. This is going to be my last year for Kindles unless they make them the same quality as before. Phooey! Easy to use with great picture. I would recommend it to a friend. This product was purchased for my Grandson. He had a fire 6. He however loves the HD 8. He uses it for music & gaming mostly. Great electronic device. This works great. I read a LOT and I needed something that would handle all my eBooks. It has all the other bells and whistles as any tablet but I use it for the eBooks and one game. Excellent! So far the tablet has been working without any issues. Haven\\'t used it enough to rate it any higher but time will tell. This is the right device to play with puzzles, you can avoid samsung/verizon constant advertisements. Only wish the battery would last longer or charge faster. My Fire is compact and easy to use. Mainly used to read online books at lunch time. The battery lasts much longer than previous tablet I had and charges much quicker. very happy with my Fire. Used it for watching television shows. The picture was clear and the audio was decent for the location of the speakers. great kid friendly product, hours of enjoyment for all. Only negative is the apps. Thought they were from android but they\\'re an Amazon version and limited. I have really enjoyed my new kindle and the ability to take pictures. It stays charged a long time when I am reading a book or watching a movie. I just wish that kindles could run on an LTE network as well when you do not have a WiFi signal. The clarity of the screen and the back-lit text makes this an improvement from my old tablet. I now can read this in low light and enjoy the color as well. I am enjoying my new Kindle, but it did present some challenges in its set up. I would recommend getting help in the store to get you started. I have had this for several weeks. It works great. I am very satisfied with it so far. This is my 3rd Kindle upgrade. I love everything about it. The ebooks read to me at night, the games and the movies show extremely well...feels as though I am right there. My kids have ipads...but I\\'m stuck on my Kindle. Never without my Amazon HD 8 - great for reading, games and surfing the networks. Awesome and best e-book reader. I love the smooth page translations, bedtime shade and perfect hand held device. Kindle Fire has took their e reader to the next level. Great apps, music, and storage expansion for the price. Bought this for a work fundraiser and the recipient enjoyed it I think this is a great product and I would recommend it. it was a good deal for this unit. they even beat amazon.... Bought it for the grandkids for Christmas. Like the parental controls! Haven\\'t had this long but so far so good. It\\'s nice when you buy a product and it works exactly how it is supposed to. I bought this for a daughter, who would be taking this to school for BYOD. It\\'s perfect size table offers, loads of amazon goodies if you are prime member. For our need, it was good enough, but one of the requirement was to have Google App support on this. Since this runs Fire OS, it\\'s everything Amazon proprietary. There as \"howto\" on web on getting google play store and its app on this, but the integration with the device lacks upon those \"fixes\" from the articles on how to get Google app store working on this tablet. Since it would not be useful for her in school because of requirements for Google apps, we\\'re returning it. Otherwise, Great tablet, but Fire OS restricts Google Apps. Bought this for my adult son who had a long flight and he absolutely loved it! Definitely recommend! So easy to use and navigate. Easy easy Amazon downloads from books to apps etc. I\\'m in the older generation that finds it hard to navigate electronics but not this tablet and Best Buy employees were great in helping me decide by giving a tutorial and info on the tablet . Fast, fluid, and lots of apps especially once I added the google play store(very simple to do and doesn\\'t require anything that voids the warranty). Display is sharp and video and games load quickly. I deducted one star as Amazon\\'s version of android lacks the ability of customization. For the price this is an excellent tablet. I have a high end laptop that does convert to tablet but at almost 16\" and the foldover design I normally just use it in laptop mode. I also have a high end \"phablet\" sized phone. So I was not sure how often I\\'d use a tablet, and did not want to spend 500ish on an ipad. The Fire has been a great \"in between\" so far on days I use my phone alot and want to avoid charging more than once per day, and don\\'t have the need to use my laptop. The speed is zippy & the screen clarity/quality is good enough. Storage is even better than ipads since it is expandable (for now I use a 64 gb card giving me a total of 96 gb, but the expandable can go up to 200 gb). Tying into Amazon is nice since I have Amazon Prime). Basic web surfing, email & facebook work great. The only \"bad\" feature is the camera & video quality. But that does not matter to me since I have my high quality camera & video recorder on my phone. Only other slight negative is light bleed noticed just when booting up on grey screen. Color/brightness uniformity is perfect to my eyes once it is up & running. Really enjoying the kindle component for book & magazine reading as well. Overall, probably the best $100 I have spent in a long time. Larger size more.memory, better price great product and wonderful service Many improvements than the older model with an excellent screen and great battery life. Great for all your tablet needs! Email, video, games, and reading! All in one!! My husband loves this. He is happy that he can read anything he chooses from his library and that he also has WiFi access to get to his email and the internet whenever he wants. I was literally still using my first gen Kindle Fire and finally upgraded. I love the new one. The only negative is the speakers. My first one is louder than this one. I have one, purchased this one for my mother in law, she had a 7 inch, between the bigger screen and HD, this one is much easier on her eyes and she can use it for longer periods of time without her eyes bothering her. But, I can\\'t figure out how to move books I\\'ve read, into the Cloud? I don\\'t like clutter, and the more I read and download, just clogs up. It\\'s great to some extent but I was expecting more. It\\'s unfortunate that it does not work with lots of apps. Perhaps I\\'m not using them correctly. I\\'m still learning. Bought as gift for my granddaughter who is 10. She loves it. Plays games, watches videos and listens to music. GREAT MEMORY,GREAT MOVIES,GREAT READING, GREAT GAMES,DO I HAVE TO SAY MORE This is the third Fire tablet I have bought. The larger size is nice. I don\\'t know much about tablets but the sales associate recommended this one for me. It does what I need and more but I just don\\'t know how to use it yet. I talk myself into the 32g and I am so glad I did!!! I have used only kindles for the past 5 years and I love them.... I love the color as well!!! The kindle over all is great. There\\'s only one thing I would want better and that is the speaker. My last kindle was louder. I really miss the louder speaker. I bought this as a Christmas gift for my wife and things started out well but lately my wife has been having issues with it. It hasn\\'t been working as it should and its only been a little over 2 months since she\\'s had it. I\\'m going to try a hard reset on it and see if that helps. Purchased this as a gift for my wife because her B&N Nook was dying. She absolutely loves it, especially since it does so much more. I\\'m now waiting for my Nook to start acting up so that I have an excuse to get a Kindle for myself. I would recommend anyone buy this product., just awesome. Love my new Kindle fire. This replaces my old one and is just as good. Videos are as good as my tv with cable. Well with every penny spent and better deal than when I tried Amazon. We replaced and aging fire HDX. She noticed the WiFi connection is improved and the screen is larger. She prefers this to my iPad Air Nice little tablet with great features. Bought one for my mom so she can read without all the weight of a big book. She also loves the nice backlight so she can be on her tablet at night without the lights on. Wanted something with a kids mode on it so we could limit time and content. This works. Saw it for a really low price so couldn\\'t resist otherwise we would have gotten the padded kids version. I was looking to upgrade from my old Kindle reader and stumbled on the Fire HD which is not only a reader but a tablet as well. Fairly easy to use. I really only needed to read books but how have a tablet as well. I wish it supported all google play apps and not just Amazon apps but I can check email and get to the web so it serves the purpose. But...when I want to read in the middle of the night, getting to the web can be distracting. In my opinion it\\'s very slow for internet use. Good for our 5 yr old to use but we purchased this for her to do online curriculums, which is almost impossible to do with this tablet because of the speed. Our internet connection is great with every other laptop and computer in the house. easy to use. nice sides and easy to read ,, also very easy to load Had a prob with original one I purchased and Bedt Buy replaced it hassle free I would recommend the Fire Tablet to anyone. IT is very easy to set up, download apps and use. Movies are crisp and clear. Bought this mostly as a backup.and to read a few books, since I have a larger cell phone and a back up. Used it occasionally may 40 or 50 hours of use till this week when I sent my laptop in for repairs. so I probably used it a tot this week. I was watching my 3rd Primetime video this week and it simply turned off. It will not turn on using any power trick such as safe mode. It is gone, It is toast. Bought it October 11, 2016 , It quit on February 9, 2015. My old Fire lasted 4 or 5 years with more use. it had stereo speakers, lasted a week on a charge not 2 or 3 days.Sturdier built. This is full of junk, I am not just offered more apps, it is constantly trying to add them. JUNK JUNK JUNK This is a very good tablet. The only con is you may have to reboot it too often. I hate amazon app store. Nothing good in there. The tablet is too slow for what I do... it is good for reading only.... This is my second Fire. Wanted a larger size to make eBooks easier to read. Very pleased with the size and clarity of this tablet. Easy to take along in a tote. Perfect for what I wanted it for.'"

       "'This product so far has not disappointed. My children love to use it and I like the ability to monitor control what content they see with ease. great for beginner or experienced person. Bought as a gift and she loves it Inexpensive tablet for him to use and learn on, step up from the NABI. He was thrilled with it, learn how to Skype on it already... I\\'ve had my Fire HD 8 two weeks now and I love it. This tablet is a great value.We are Prime Members and that is where this tablet SHINES. I love being able to easily access all of the Prime content as well as movies you can download and watch laterThis has a 1280/800 screen which has some really nice look to it its nice and crisp and very bright infact it is brighter then the ipad pro costing $900 base model. The build on this fire is INSANELY AWESOME running at only 7.7mm thick and the smooth glossy feel on the back it is really amazing to hold its like the futuristic tab in ur hands. I bought this for my grand daughter when she comes over to visit. I set it up with her as the user, entered her age and name and now Amazon makes sure that she only accesses sites and content that are appropriate to her age. Simple to do and she loves the capabilities. I also bought and installed a 64gig SD card which gives this little tablet plenty of storage. For the price I think this tablet is best one out there. You can spend hundreds of dollars more for additional speed and capacity but when it comes to the basics this tablets does everything that most people will ever need at a fraction of the cost. This amazon fire 8 inch tablet is the perfect size. I purchased it for my husband so that he has a bigger screen than just his phone. He had gotten me one a few years ago so I knew it would be a good purchase. Great for e-reading on the go, nice and light weight, and for the price point given, definitely worth the purchase. I gave this as a Christmas gift to my inlaws, husband and uncle. They loved it and how easy they are to use with fantastic features! Great as a device to read books. I like that it links with my borrowed library e-books. Switched from another popular tablet brand and I am happy with the choice I made. It took some time to get books from my previous non-Kindle reader, but finally figured out a way! I love ordering books and reading them with the reader. Not easy for elderly users cease of ads that pop up. Excellent product. Easy to use, large screen makes watching movies and reading easier. Wanted my father to have his first tablet and this is a very good value. He can watch movies and play a few games. Easy enough for him to use. Simply does everything I need. Thank youAnd silk works wonders Got it as a present and love the size of the screen The kindle is easiest to use, graphics and screen crisp, clear, brilliant colors. nice reader. almost perfect for what i want/need. good bargain I really like this tablet. I would have given 5 stars but sometimes you have to push start several times after you unlock the screen and it is a little annoying. Great video quality lots of fun apps fun for the whole family Love love love my kindle fire 8.....this is what my 9 yr old granddaughter said when I bought this for her at Christmas..we have purchased kindled in the past but this one has been the best....love the fact that you can now use a memory card in it...that helps so much when you use it for books...games...music and viedos...thanks Excellent tablet with nice screen. I wish Amazon would pre install the play store, this would have been perfect. Preloaded with the reading app from Kindle but expandable with other apps. Perfect for travel. Carry your library, games and productivity apps in a small footprint. Very happy with this product and easy to use..picture is clear, takes great pictures.. My grandchildren are home schooled and utilize the tables for many learning apps! They LOVE using them as it makes them feel \"so grown up\"! The tablets are a great leaning tool and they are receiving many benefits from them! Great size, easy to carry for traveling. Need to spend more time Looking into apps for contact manegement, interactive calenders and most important, music storage and use. I purchased this when my last tablet died. It meets all basic needs and the price was great. Perfect for downloading and reading books !! Perfect size and has a nice, bright screen. I was surprised when I learned of the capabilities of this device. Now my husband has more access to his desktop and I am doing things which I couldn\\'t on his device. I got it for my son. Its user friendly and durable. The visual quality on the Fire 8 HD is amazing. It runs very fast and is easy to use, very durable. If your looking for a affordable gift this is it!. This is a great tablet for the price, would recommend it to anyone looking for a basic tablet. Works great. Love the portability of books. Overall great product I am still learning all the things I can do with my new Kindle Fire. It is so much better (lighter in weight and easier to use) than my old tablet. Just the right size for reading books and playing some games. I love everything about this tablet! The imaging is sharp and clear. It\\'s fast and light weight. Love it! Overall a nice product for traveling purposes Value for money My children love this table great quality of pictures, excellent camera I bought 3 tablets and my family was not disappointed. Great tablet fast screen good size never gives me problem Bought this for my 87 year old grandmother who wanted to be able to play games and read books from the library. My aunt lives with her and can help her use it so its perfect for that type of user. After playing with It, I would consider it for just about anyone other than a hardcore user that wants the latest and greatest tech. if you are tech saavy, you can do more with these Fire tablets than advertised. This is exactly what the person wanted as a gift and she enjoys using it. Does all basic functions of a tablet. Hardcore users may want an iPad. Works great for a simple tablet. Not a huge fan of the silk browser but it could be worse! I am very happy with my purchase! It\\'s fast and easy to use. This is my second kindle fire . More flexibility than a Kindle and bigger screen. Like it because I can surf the web and download and read books. For the money you cannot beat this tablet. Full of features, picture quality is great, and very fast speed while using the internet. Easy to use, solid build, sharp HP screen for movies. Who needs more? Tablet is perfect for beginners who just want basic this is my first tablet .. love it .. actually read my first e-book on it .. large screen, easy to read & play games .. fits nicely in my purse This 8 inch Fire is definitely better than the cheaper 7 inch. It works fine enough for teens to play games and watch movies. Great tablet for under $100. Does not have the highest specs, but gets the job done for lite tablet users. I purchased the kindle fire because I needed a entertainment only device for long flights. This device is the perfect size for travel and easy to use and set up with your Amazon account. It is worth purchasing a Fire tablet if you are an Amazon Prime member. If not, I would not recommend it because the available apps are limited . My only complaint about this device is that if it freezes it is difficult to reset. This fire tablet has long battery life. Reasonable fast Got this for my wife and she loves it. She had the previous generation and this one is a giant keep forward. Sleek packaging easy set up and great for anyone who wants a e reader with more to offer. Best and most affordable option of all the Kindle devices available. I did not want to get a new kindle but my old one would not charge or show a charge anymore. I could not depend on it for any length of time so I finally broke down and bought a new one. I am very happy with this one. I was afraid I would lose my music and photos since not all came from the Amazon store. However, everything I had on the old kindle transferred to the new one. I am still learning all about it but so far so good. My daughter likes this tablet to play her online games! Easy to figure out and used it extensively on my vacation. Excellent tablet to leave at my easel and display reference photos. It\\'s light enough to velcro to a articulating stand (so I can position the tablet right next to my canvas). It\\'s cheap enough to not worry about. I love it, for the price. I bought this wanting for books comics and movies and it has not disappoint ever since My 4 year old Grandson loves his Kindle. He had to have one after his sister got one. Easy to use. As a beginner I found this pad very good. Enjoy the kindle app. This Kindle does what I need it to do. The camera could be better but overall I am pretty happy with my purchase. Purchased this for my daughter to do more reading. It has so much more options for her if she wants. this is a great tablet for the price. my kid loves it ,does alot reading on it. I was really hoping that this would be faster than some other inexspensive tablets I\\'ve had. I mainly use it for email though and it does the job. Bought as a Christmas gift for someone. I bought iPad as well. Will update when it\\'s used. Great tablet for the price. It is easy to navigate. I believe that this will be very useful during my husbands recovery from foot surgery. This is something that is useful if your looking for something to take along trips This is a wonderful device. I love the extra capabilities and apps. Decent tablet. Access to kindle and pretty much all your google apps. I am very happy with this tablet. The worst thing is that my steals it all the time. Lol A family member has vision problems. They had seen/used the Kindle of another family member - especially the ability to scale text. This device will make it possible to read, which she has had extreme difficulty doing. Easy setup and connect to WIFI. Great viewing area. Easy to read in bright places. I got this fire for my friend who wants to buy kindle..this serves both Kindle and Tab... very nice and very cheap..worth for what i paid.. I highly recommend this for beginners Really enjoyed the price value of this tablet versus ipad Amazing tablet with fast processor. It looks great... got good deal We got this for our 5 year old and this is really great for the price. Works like a charm!! I find it easy to use, but the kindle does not come with instructions, so you have to find your way around. I bought this because I was tired of watching Youtube and Twitch on my phone. Excellent display sound is decent-not great but you can always buy a speaker. The negatives are-it is definitely a fingerprint magnet, and the Spectrum TV app is AWFUL-the app works fine on my phone, but for some reason on this tablet it freezes and is unusable. All things considered, for 65 bucks it\\'s hard to be beat. I love this tablet. The battery life last a long time. I use my Amazon Kindle Fire predominately for watching movies on Amazon Prime, Netflix\\'s, and checking my emails. I also carry it to my appointments and meetings. It is a compact tablet, and not big and bulky. The playback of the movies are great, and the movies are HD. Great little tablet if you are looking for something to watch movies and checking emails. I would definitely recommend this tablet to friends and family members. My daughter loves this kindle, she does so much with it,well worth the money. Was looking for a tablet that was highly portable & could run my DIRECTTV app & stream videos. (Other electronics I have are much older versions). Salesman recommended this model to me based on personal experience. I am still learning all its functions but so far it seems easy to use & is doing what it promised to do. This is my second Fire, the other one is now retired. I like having HD. Works just fine. My wife bought this for me for my birthday. I enjoy reading biographys which usually have color photos. The regular Kindle make the pics black and white or they\\'re aren\\'t any. This allows me to see the color photos. I also love the night feature when I\\'m in bed reading. I no longer need a light on to read or need to hold a large book. Thanks to a knowledgeable, low-pressure salesperson, I was ready to buy my first tablet. This one was the right price (on sale) and I have not been disappointed. Every few days I learn more ways to use it besides checking e-mails & checking out library books & audio books. It stays charged for days, even with regular use. I recommend it as an inexpensive and very satisfactory alternative to more expensive tablets. It\\'s a great tablet for the price. Don\\'t expect it to be as fast more expensive ones. It\\'s meant for casual use and it does a great job at that. For the price, you can\\'t beat it. Get a nice large microsd card and you don\\'t have to worry about space. It runs a little slow on certain things if you are multitasking but it\\'s a simple tablet. I\\'ve run plenty of 720p videos without fail. It\\'s great for ebooks or other files. Some more elaborate pdfs take a while to load if they have a lol of graphics. Battery life seems good for a small table too.The only real Issue I have is the Amazon App store being limited. It is an offshoot of Android but not all the same apps are available. There is a way around it but I wish they would just allow it access to Google Play or at least offer the same apps.So, it\\'s a nice inexpensive table that works great. For the money, you will love it but don\\'t get upset that is doesn\\'t run as fast as a $500 tablet. That\\'s not its job. Bought it for my 10 yr old granddaughter. Does everything she wants it to do in a tablet. Very easy to use tablet. Lots of apps and game available. We love the FreeTime settings for kids on the newer Kindle Fires. I was able to create a login for each of our kids as well as myself and set limits to the amount of device time they are allowed daily (can set to more for weekends if desired). You can set the age restrictions for content also, to avoid inappropriate ads, etc. Once you\\'ve downloaded apps, you can choose which ones you want each child to have access to in their profile settings, so if one child is older you can allow them access to something their younger siblings shouldn\\'t have. Basically, I like that I can set their access rights and know they\\'re safe so I don\\'t have to continually monitor every moment. By the way, FreeTime kids settings are available without having to subscribe to their FreeTime app access plan. :) Great tablet, very clear picture. Would buy again. Good reader which is why I bought it. Ads are annoying. It\\'s a mini computer packed in a handheld devise. Applications load quickly and I am able to get my work completed, while riding the commuter rail. Nice for a smaller tablet. It\\'s good for Internet surfing. Purchased as a door prize gift given with a one year Amazon membership. The recipient loves it and says it performs very well. (As a past Amazon Fire user, now i-Pad graduate, I loved my Amazon Fire for more than 4 years without any problems. In fact, I just recycled it on to my son and it runs like a champ). I have 4 other kinds of tables. This the best I have had. I can listen to music, read a book, listen to a book, or watch movies/tv shows. Great product for the kids gaming apps parental controls to make sure you can monitor kids and prevent unwanted app purchases I purchased 2 of these tablets for my 6 and 8 year old. They were a Black Friday special for $59. They are perfect for the apps and games they wanted. Great product. Love the Amazon ecosystem. The Freetime subscription is a must Needed something a bit larger than the 6+ to stream Netflix, this was perfect! my husband bought this for me as a Christmas present. I couldn\\'t understand why he bought it because I already have a Kindle Fire.Once I opened it and got it going, I loved all it could do plus the graphic is so much colorful than my older Kindle. my grandson-8-loves this --the games and the books! Great product and I\\'m very satisfied with it. I recommend it to other people. I purchased this tablet for my niece for Christmas and she love it. Easy to use, responds quickly, great screen brightness. Great tablet but apps limited comparison of other tablets. Works as we thought it should. NO PROBLEMS. Good buying experience. We have the smaller one, and been great. This one is even better, because of the size. I am a prime member & I love this tablet. Very user friendly especially if you are a prime member with amazon. Not real tech savvy so I need all the help I can get to keep things simple & automatic. Great clarity of picture/data. Have a 10\" tablet and wasn\\'t sure about downgrading size (old eyes) but was delighted to see it works fine at 8\" instead of 10\". Also, easier to take around in the smaller size. Highly recommend especially if you subscribe to Amazon and are a prime member. Great benefits!! Got this for my wife. She loves the bigger screen and the better app management features that this one has over her earlier generation kindle. Definitely worth it! Connects to home WiFi automatically. Many books, and many games. Actually functions like a computer tablet. E-mail is a breeze. Bought this to replace no-name budget tablet for my daughter. She loves this as it is much faster and has a better display than her old tablet. This is a wonderful value as it is faster, has a better display and sound, is a name brand and cost about the same ... what\\'s not to love about this product? She loves this tablet. It works well unlike her \"bargain\" tablet which she tried to use previously and cost about the same. She likes the sound of it also! She enjoys the free games she downloaded and navigates the wev easily with it. It\\'s no iPad, but it\\'s great for Netflix and some app games. I\\'m not worried about the kids getting their paws on it since it\\'s relatively inexpensive. Didn\\'t have some of the features I was looking for. Returned it the next day. May be good for others I bought this for my daughter and she loves it. It\\'s speedy when loading books! Purchased for my wife who reads a lot and truly enjoys the amazon fire. A great Christmas gift, the kids love the gifts... Daughter got this as a present. It was easy to set up and display is great. Features allow us to limit her time on games, web, etc. while allowing her unlimited time to read I have enjoyed just learning how to use it. You\\'re never too old to learn new things. bought for husband and he was surprised it does the work he needs it for This was a birthday present and it was ideal for a traveler to read ebooks on while on the rood My teenage daughter enjoyed her three year old 7\" Kindle for recreation but wanted a larger screen for word processing. Paired this with a Bluetooth keyboard and she was thrilled. i Bought this around black friday for $60 hoping it would be awesome... it failed so hard i tried multiple different micro SD cards none of which were recognized and YES i formated them with every format i could think of ... Fat32, NTFS, Fat, Xfat... i even tried to have the tablet do it... didnt work... to make matters worse half the apps i wanted to use werent in the app store and i came to find out that it isnt linked to the normal google play store this tablet has its own app store which is missing many common apps... the main reason i bought this was to play clash of clans and i cant because it wasnt on the app store... i tried to also use aftermarket play stores to play COC but it didnt work... launched and played 1 time but didnt work or update after that... needless to say i returned it and bought a $250 samsung galaxy tab A 10.1 (2016 version) with S-pen and its WAYYYYY better... bottom line you get what you pay for... also hint the s-pen version has an extra 1 GB of ram over the non pen version... so you should get that if you can afford the extra $50... The People I purchased this for during Christmas Holiday LOVED IT... I purchased two of these for my kids, ages 12 and 10. Forget the IPod touch. For the price, this tablet can\\'t be beat! They can download games, books and movies for free all included with my Amazon Prime membership. Awesome!! my kids enjoy the Fire HD and they love the picture quality Bought two of these tablets for my nieces for Christmas after we had originally bought the Amazon fire 7 inch which had a virus after 3 days of purchase and was unable to work good thing we played with it prior to giving as gift do to this being said I was very surprised on how well this tablet has held up to to not so careful 8 years olds playing with it daily we have had no problems screen is big enough for little hands to maneuver and see on was the highlight of there Christmas and still is would definitely recommend it Really like the updates this product has in comparison to my first one Functionality and ease of use are outstanding right out of the the box. Super clear screen and weight is minimum and is a joy to use. This tablet is great for kids and adults who have little to no knowledge of computers. It handles easily and has plenty of storage My god sister has been using these for years.What to read more! The latest Amazon 8\" HD tablet is a very good tablet for the price. The updated processor and extra memory (with expansion slot) allow for very good performance on all that we use this tablet for. Netflix, Hulu, browsing the internet, and doing e-mails all work very smoothly. Would recommend to anyone looking for a very cost effective tablet totally worth the money, has all the apps I use on a daily basis! Good tablet. Wife loves it and would recommend.... I use mine mainly for its bigger screen. I do all the same things i do on my phone..but love the big screen. I bought one for eaxh of my nieces too. And they both love theres. Making videos..playing music..reading books. They bith love them! Im happy i got them for all of us. And always reccomend them to my friends for their kids too. Amazon Fire HD8 is a great product for the price. I picked it up for $69 during the holiday shopping season. Replacing a 1st gen Samsung Tab 2. This thing is sooo much faster. Perfect size for reading Kindle books , emails, and doing the social media thing. It was a good gift for the price and had many features and options Not as fancy as the ipad, but a fraction of the cost works well with android system and all apps like on our android phones, cant beat the price My kids can play, read, watch movies and much more love it!!! Great tablet for reading books, but the bluetooth is hard to get working and there are much better tablets for games and movies I love this Kindle!! I am biased I think however I have had 3 previous ones I prefer Kindles to any other tablet This is a great tablet for kids. I love that their time on the tablet can be restricted. Easy to use. Good size. Great eReader. Not so expensive that I worry about my kids using it. This Tablet was purchased for our Grandmother so she could play games and read books on. Bought a few of these for Christmas gifts .Everyone is happy !Its a great device for the $$. Low price, and great quality as always from FIRE devices. I purchased this item for my husband and he has liked reading Kindle books on it and the other features like Silk, etc. Light little tablet with good features. Bought this for our year end holiday party raffle prize pool. Great price and people always have a use for an amazon tablet. Came with Kaspersky for free as well, which is a pretty generous complimentary add on. My 6 yr old daughter got this tablet from Santa for Christmas. So far she loves it, a little too much perhaps.. I only use it to manage her account/permissions and so far haven\\'t had any issues with it.. Software and HW not quite as refined as apple iPad products, but what can you expect at the lower price point. my opinion its a good option for the cost. Not as great as Apple Ipad, but it costs so much less. Still can get good use Has many educational apps I would definitely go into the settings if you\\'re a mother like me who Is a very strict of what your children watch on TV or what games and apps they download I would definitely recommend setting the parental controls before giving it to them. In my personal opinion as a mother I feel it helps by setting the restrictions/content on It helps keep their mind away from the gutter Bcuz most apps and Internet websites have inappropriate sites children should not be watching. We can\\'t control what they put on the Internet but we can control what our children watch and download they stay very occupied on educational apps ,read books most of these apps are free to I also recommend NOT putting a payment method option other than that my kids loved it the hd feature is what sold me on this product, along with the fact its a lotmore streamline than the older version that I have Very nice for light internet browsing, keeping on top of email, viewing videos, and reading e books, which I like to get free from the library. Good browser, good battery power, fast charge. Very relaxing to sit in a comfy chair and read or browse. Has given me hours of enjoyment and information for a minimal price. I bought this for my wife to replace her old Kindle and she loves it. Much easier to read than an iPad and updated features make it a great purchase. Great tablet and price. Ordering online easy. Not happy took so long to receive though. Best tablet, good price, nice looking. Ordering on line was easy. I got this for my mom for Christmas. Every time I visit, she shows me something else she can do with it. I\\'m so jealous, I hope I get one. This is my fourth Kindle...upgrading each time. Mine goes everywhere with me and is used throughout the day. Wouldn\\'t be without it. We bought this for our son when he went to college. He is able to upload all of his books and other documents. I purchased it for my mother-in-law and she loves it it was easier for her to use and understand The Amazon Fire is amazing! Picture clarity and sound are excellent! I highly recommend this tablet! Love it! Sharp picture and easy to use. And a fantastic price I like this is great I bought it my friend he was pleased abount I wanted a low cost but quality tablet and this one is a dream! Easy to navigate and excellent graphics. This a great tablet for everyone. Plenty of memory for downloading. Great features all around. I own two Nook tablets, another Kindle and a Samsung and this is the best one yet. Excellent battery life. Lets me check emails the Web and with Kindle. books can be switched from reads to listens. Also works better than the Nook with audiobooks. I bought this tablet for my 4 year old daughter. Too many advertisements. I would rather pay more and not have a single ad. This is a step up from what my son was using. He said it does well and easy to use. This is a good tablet for kids who are starting off I bought this for my 6 year old and it\\'s perfect. Faster & clearer than older versions. Awesome good size large enough for games and photos Great gift easy to use and she loves being able to take it anywhere I bought this to replace the 7 inch version I lost in the airport. I wanted the bigger screen and the higher resolutions. It is much when loading games in offline mode as well as videos I have downloaded from Amazon Prime to play on the plane when wifi is not available. That was a plus for me. And now that the updated Netflix app allows the same thing, I have plenty of videos. I can also play my .mp4 videos using VLC player that I load to a microSD card. Of course you have wifi and Bluetooth so great for surfing try he net or listening to music. The 8 in screen is perfect for lying in bed and watching my show. I highly recommend this. Intuitive user interface, rapid online access through well designed features, light weight, ergonomic buttons for volume and power. Overall a thoroughly well designed, excellent priced device for web browsing and social media. PURCHASED THIS WITH A STORE CREDIT AND LIKE IT A LOT. COMPARES WELL WITH MORE EXPENSIVE TABLETS..RECOMMENDED great device for the price. good looking screen, quick and efficient. amazon app store isn\\'t that bad either Great gift for any age. Wish I bought two. I can do everything on this that I was doing on my ipad Great budget tablet for web browsing. Also useful as an MP3 player and ebook reader. I got 2 of these for my 8 yr old twins. My 11 yr old has one but this one is better. Perfect way to get them to read This is a superb tablet for the price. It doesn\\'t come with the Android operating system. It has Amazon\\'s operating system. The battery last a good long time and apps run very fast. I would recommend this to anyone who wants a tablet. My daughter love her new tablet, I use for a few days and it\\'s pretty good So very happy with the new kindle ! I highly recommend this product ! It may be cheap but this is a great tablet and works awesome. My wife absolutely loves this tablet. It wad an early Christmas present Bought for my 11 year old son and he absolutely loves it. I bought this as a Christmas gift for my son. Very easy to use. This product is very handy on the go. I can check emails and find work for my truck. I am an Amazon Fan. Ive only had Amazon tablets so I cant compare them with any other brand. But, Amazon has great customer service, a lot of great apps. The HD 8 is a great tablet for watching movies, most games, and social media. Its not as good as the Kindle fire hdx. The speakers arent as good, the hdx has more of a surround sound, but the hd 8 is less expensive, has a place for a sims card for extra space, and has an ok front and rear facing camera. Overall its a great tablet for a great price. I previously had bought an older model of these tablets for my children. I wasn\\'t to happy with them. But this tablet is great, it has child safety features like wether you would like to have them surf the web to even limiting the amount of hours your child can use it. Very good tablet for what my kids will use it for which is mostly Netflix Hulu and even though there isn\\'t you tube app there are alternate apps that acces you tube. Got this tablet for Black Friday. Wow, 16 gigs, great screen, expandable memory, what a deal. Tablet is a must have for Amazon Prime members. It unlocks the door for all those great Prime perks; books, shows, and shopping. Pairs to Alexa. Great screen for books! Buy it already! Bought it on black Friday for 60$ .Value for money tablet. It lags at heavy tasks and also apps are reloaded when 2-3 apps are opened at same time. But at this price it is expected. Go for it if budget is <100$. overall this is a good tablet. it is best with those who have Prime Amazon and the ability to watch Amazon video. a good price for a good tablet but has limitations based on the operating system. for video watching and basic use a good choice I love the size and portability of this. Keeps me in touch and having fun. Nice tablet and couldn\\'t beat the Black Friday price I\\'m sorry I didn\\'t buy it sooner! Very easy to use. Love it. It feels a bit more rugged than my original Fire tablet, and I believe it is an excellent value. Good tablet for basic needs. Screens resolution is pretty good. Mostly using for reading and sometimes for watching movies/shows. Great feature is the possibility to use the card to expand the memory. Good product for great price! Bought as a gift for my 86 yr old mom to stalk her kids and grandkids on FB. She mastered it in a few.minutes with minimal instruction. Now I have to watch my posts. For a cheaper price this does more than my kindle- love having this tablet Had a smaller version. Love the bigger screen. Use this product more than a computer. I bought 2 of the kindles for my grandsons. They love them! Had them charged and set up right away. No issues at this point. Easy to use bought for our 5 year old, found a case which allows him to keep it safe. Great 8 inches tablet with and amazing storage for apps. Santa dropped this off for our 4th grader along with expanded memory. he uses it for Netflix and Youtube as well as Minecraft and other Apps. Why spend hundreds on something for basic kids needs? I\\'m sure this will last him a few years and is well worth the price. Got this tablet for my 3 year old son and he can not put it down. It is so much to do. So many learning games. I love this product This tablet runs smooth with all amazon apps, the internet runs at a steady frame rate and it had a decent sized screen. This is a good device for entertainment and entry level tasks. I think it can do a lot for the price. Nice price for the new model with Alexa built in and expandable storage! I have enjoyed the new Kindle,however, was extremely disappointed that it does not have an HDMI port like the old version did. this product is really awesome for kids to play in all sorts.We can use a strong case and let kids play in it . i like the features it has and it is easy to navigate. This is perfect my kids to do their school work on and have fun as well. Great gift for my dad. Clear picture and easy set up Love my kindle! Works better than expected! Kindle is much faster than my old tablet! I have never owned a tablet. Wanted an I-Pad like most, but couldn\\'t afford the sticker price. This one fit my needs perfect. I mainly just use it for web surfing and streaming video. No complaints so far! I would recommend this device. also great for listening to music and also for movies The screen picture is crisp and bright. I will use this tablet for many things. small and powerful... great adult toy for a reader This was purchased as a Christmas present for my aunt who lives with us. For the price, I thought it would be a good option for her since she doesn\\'t want to drop the cash on an iPad.For comparison, the closest thing I have is an 8\" insignia tablet with similar screen resolution, storage, and features that was released at the same time. The Fire tablet impresses me! It is more responsive than the existing android tablet I have.This tablet runs FireOS which is Amazon\\'s customized version of Android. Typically I do not like custom Android, preferring to have as close to a vanilla system as possible. I am not bothered by that with the Fire. If you need them the parental controls are second to none! The Amazon app store is extensive, although not as extensive as the Google Play store. Still you should be able to find pretty much everything you need there.This is not a flagship device, but performs incredibly for the price. I will most likely be purchasing one soon for myself. I was hoping to use Google launcher with this tablet but it is really locked down and you cannot change the launcher or the lock screen. Still cheap and fine for watching movies. Great tablet for reading and also surfacing the web, along with your favorite social media apps! The price is low because Amazon uses their adds to subsidize the price. The actual tablet works well. The biggest negative is that you can only install apps from the Amazon store. There are many Android Apps available in the google store that are not available in the Amazon store.I primarily use the tablet for bible gateway, dish anywhere, play some games, read the newspaper, and Facebook. In the future I want to try to use it with my local library. Screen is very clear and battery last a long time. Very good substitute if you can afford a iPad. The tablet works fine. It is responsive with good resolution. It is too tied to Amazon. It requires too many hoops to get apps such as Zinio to work. Until Amazon loosens its grip, I recommend only at a very good price. A Great value for the money you can save instead of a Ipad from Apple. Fun and reliable. Good quality for the money. Easy to use. Great for reading - nice image, easy on the eyes and lightweight. Bought this for my 10 year old daughter for Christmas! She LOVES it!!! A great alternative to a pricey iPad Mini!!! She uses it for watching Netflix, YouTube and we use it for homeschool. We are very happy with our purchase!!! I got this tablet on sale for my wife and she loves it So far so good with the kindle fire hd. still need to play with it to see how to maximize our use. We love Kindle Fire, we purchase it for an older couple and it\\'s easy to work. The Amazon Fire is a great tablet with awesome graphics. I use it mainly for surfing the web and have had no issues with it. Purchased for my nephew for Christmas. Used it everyday. Very good product and screen size is perfect for him. Great tablet for the price. My granddaughter loves how user friendly it is. got this for my nieces aged 6-13 they loved it and so did their parents really keeps them occupied This was a gift for mom. She enjoys that it\\'s easy to use and has good picture and sound quality. The price was also great Was wanting a bigger screen, which it is, trying to get use to different applications, so far seems easy. The Amazon fire is simply amazing I would not buy anything else. Didn\\'t want to go to the sites amazon wanted me to. We bought this for our three daughters! Got a kid proof case and added free time for a low monthly fee and couldn\\'t be happier! So much better than worrying about them breaking my phone or iPad! I love my Kindle. I won\\'t be without one. I\\'ve even bought an extra one, just in case. I believe it\\'s the best tablet on the market. Bought one to replace the smaller (non HD) version. Lot faster and picture is noticeably better. Would recommend for anyone not wanting to spend the extra $50 or so on the big names. Could not have asked for a better tablet for the money. I wasn\\'t looking for anything extreme. Just wanted it to look nice and do it\\'s job for games and browsing. Well it does that and more. Gave it to our son for Christmas and now I want one myself. We are going to buy another for my mother in law. Lightweight, simple layout. Snappy. Can\\'t go wrong. It was a perfect gift for my godson. He loved it! Definitely would recommend this product. I can do a lot of things on my Kindle I used to rely on the computer for. Excellent resource for children video streaming by Wifi using mobile hotspot with kids. The kindle fire tablets are great for the price. They have solid performance in battery life and processing power. The only downside is that the Operating System is a different variation of Android, so there could be some incompatibilities. best choice under 100$ in marketamazon is the best!!! I really didnt expect how its going to work.but its very good.gifted to my friend Bought this as a gift for my mom and this was to replace her original Kindle Fire. She\\'s have had a month now and is loving and no problems with it. This was a request from our 7 yr old granddaugter who had always asked her older sister if she could share hers due to we bought this same tablet/size a few yrs earlier. Loved the security/parental control options.Starfall a favorite educational app were told is a must have. Really enjoy Pics/Viber due to their in a different state. Also some games on a time limit. Size and resolution are perfect. This is the best device I have found for my e-books. I know it can be used for a lot more, but it is my library in my hand. I bought this tablet to be pretty much exclusively an e-reader. It\\'s actually cheaper than most of the kindles. For that limited use, it works fine. I don\\'t think I would want to use it as a general purpose table (too slow!). Makes a fine e-reader though. As for recommending this to a friend, I would, but would make sure they knew what I use it for. I bought this as a Christmas present for my sister and she LOVES it. It\\'s easy to use, lightweight and doesn\\'t seem to have a lot of bugs or glitches. It\\'s a good source of entertainment for when she\\'s at work but has down-time. She passes the time reading ebooks, browsing the web and playing games. I originally purchased a Kindle paperwhite but returned it the next day and purchased this one. Very easy to read on, watch movies, and listen to music. Works well. Easy to use. Battery seems to be good. Would buy again. Ticks all the boxes I was looking for at a price I was happy to pay. One caveat that I (or the Best Buy and Geek Squad crews) was unaware of: there is a glitch in the keyboard that prevents it from working properly. Kindle/Amazon are aware of the glitch and will download a third-party keyboard fix to replace the keyboard that\\'s built in to the unit until they are able to fix the problem. I made Geek Squad aware of it and they should know about it now. Amazon MayDay functionality is not available and this was unexpected. Other services and functionality as expected Perfect tablet to take anywhere you go and lighter than my IPad. Easy to use tablet for every day use. Additional apps can help increase productivity for work and daily use. This tablet does all I need a tablet to do. Reason why it\\'s my 3rd one. Bought this tablet for my fiancée daughter, after getting it home and set up, I decided to keep it for myself. Great screen and works great with my pair of Amazon echos. I love it and highly recommend it. This is my first Amazon e-reader-tablet and the second e-reader I have. It is easy to use once you get through the initial hoops. I like the free games and the fact that I new can load books from my computer to the tablet. And one thing, I am not in the market for a tablet but for a bigger e-reader. It is a lot better than the Nook that I have. I love this product Bought as a gift for parents who aren\\'t tech savy but were able to use it with ease I have Bought several versions of this tablet for my kids over the years and have been ever impressed with it. I first got one for my son, the my oldest daughter to replace her children\\'s tablet, which was worthless, this tablet gives you everything you could want and allows you to control what your kids access on it and even lets you see what they download onto it. if you want to set a time when it shuts off at night you can, when they can play games or use Netflixs you can...great product! Great gift for a younger person who wants a tablet The fire is great. The size is really nice. Not to big. The clarity is really good. This inexpensive tablet does everything I want it to do. I can read my books and magazines and keeps tabs on my kids and grandkids on Facebook. Very easy to use and crystal clear pictures and video. Great entry level tablet for kids or anyone that will not be heavily using a tablet. The 16 GB, is too small but can add an SD card. Beware only comes with 6GB of the 16 for your apps. Comes with bunch of preloaded Amazon apps. This tablet is great. I loved the color and all the features it has. I will be buying more for my daughters. Great purchase What I expected. A better then budget tablet ata good price. Bought for the integration with Alexa and it works well, more info about your Alexa request will show up automatically on the tablet. It\\'s a excellent tablet for my kid she downloaded games and watch cartoons I was looking for a Good tablet under $100..this delivered..getting used to Amazon apps LOL Excellent ratio quality price. Lightweight. Good resolution and easy to use. After long review decided to buy the Fire Tablet as a gift for a great frienday. She loves it! It\\'s the perfect size and has all the features she was looking for in a tablet. Happy Birthday! Love everything about my Kindle. I\\'m a long-term Amazon Prime member. Great tablet for the price. My father in law likes the easy use of the tablet. The Fire is an excellent table for many basic tasks. Not a good product short battery life i can only use for 20 minutes I was looking for something to read on and this fit the bill for the right price.Great screen clarity, good adjustment too. Works well and the battery life is great. Size is nice too. Big enough for 1 hand if needed. This is a great tablet for books, games and web browsing. It is very user friendly, -and I would definitely recommend this product! I enjoy to use the reader and like the idea that I can go to the internet from the Kindle. I thought that this tablet was junk but it has surpassed my expectations I wasn\\'t really expecting much, however I was pleasantly surprised.It feels solid, responsive, screen is good.For the price its a bargain!! Good if you want something inexpensive and Will do the minimum very well. I like this ipads for my baby and me too,special and super ok thanks byee I found it to be very versatile and enjoyable benefiting from a touch screen. Ipad killer! A fierce tablet at a convinient price! bought as a gift she loves it all kinds of apps easy to use and even easyer with amazon prime I bought it as the display for my Echo. Turning on Voicecast routes information to the tablet with the voice reaponse. It\\'S been exactly what I hoped it would be and the price was right. This tablet is exactly what I was looking for to take on trips. The kids can watch their movies and videos, or I can read from my kindle library. Perfect size. I bought this as a gift for my son and I know he will love it he has the old kindle fire as likes it a lot My mom had an old one, she was so excited to get this one. Works great and is fast. Great for reading and internet use This Kindle is so overloaded with apps that I will never use. Despite what one of Best Buys\\' associates said, you cannot remove any of the Amazon apps. The apps take up too much of the memory. I have an I Pad and love but bought this as a backup for work. Unfortunately, it bogs down. I also don\\'t like that Amazon wants access to too much info to set up email, so I won\\'t use this for emails either. I will likely sell it on Craig\\'s List for less than half of what I paid for it. Fine for reading, ...haven\\'t used it for anything else yet I have been using a Kindle Fire for a couple of years. It was a good tablet, until the screen went black. Best Buy replaced it and I couldn\\'t have been more pleased. I enjoy reading on my Kindle Fire HD more than ever. Try it and you\\'ll buy it! A viable substitute for the more expensive I Pad especially for kids wanting a tablet. You can download books, games, email and access the internet. Parental controls are easily enabled. blueray is just twhat I was I was looking for great for watching movies thank you Love best buy and I shop at Best Buy I always buy my TV for me and my kids I buy my kids tablets at Best Buy Love Best Buy Got this for my mom for her birthday, and she absolutely loves it. Great tablet for the price point, good tablet overall. I love all of them. I would recommend going to Best Buy and buying a kindle fire before they are sold out! Nice size screen easy and light weight to take to class This tablet is great for my son. Would be nice if it had a little more horsepower My 76 year old mom loves this! She now has something to do while waiting in doctors offices - loves to read, do crosswords, etc. I enjoy it more then the I-pad that its replacing. Easy to read in any light and the size is perfect for travel. I absolutely love my kindle 8! Great picture, storage & sound. Can\\'t live without my kindle! I liked it at first except the browser is kind of clunky. Also you can. It use all android Apps. The worst thing though was mine just stopped working in the middle of watching a movie on a long plane flight. It was fully charged. I have tried recharging and turning on etc. it is just a blank screen and off. Kind of a cool paperweight. Hope I can get my money back. Or get a new one. Love my mine! Works great with prime! And I have all my best movies! I bought this for my dad in his late 60s mainly to listen to music and read ebooks borrowed from the library. I set it up for him and he loves it. I just don\\'t like that it has ads on the start up unless you pay to get rid of them. Enjoy reading books on it as well as viewing videos. Got two for my mom\\'s and they love it. So many great features!!! this tablet is awesome. the fact that I can use a micro sd card to have more memory and can listen to my content on the card is great. the additional screen size is what I wanted and it has not disappointed. this was a great purchase!!! I\\'m very happy with my Kindle Fire. Beyond being able to read books, it does all sorts of things and is able to download a huge variety of apps. It also holds a charge very long. The size is perfect and portable, yet the screen is much larger than a smartphone, which I love. I would definitely recommend this tablet to others! The Amazon Fire HD 8 is an awesome device. THE PRICE OF THIS TABLET IS MIND BOGGLING!! This tablet has everything you would expect and want in a tablet and more. It has Amazon Store and Amazon Prime preloaded. It\\'s so much fun and so easy to use. THE PERFORMANCE OF THIS TABLET IS UNBELIEVABLE. You never stop thinking about the modest price you paid for such a fantastic tablet. It feels comfortable in your hands. The design is nice. The size is adequate for all tablet use. You can expand the memory storage of this device an additional 240GB. Can you believe it? Outstanding!! Bought as a Christmas present. Son uses it to watch youtube and Netflick. Works great. The overall design makes it fir very nice in the hand. It is very easy to setup and has features that I did not utilize on previous Fire tablets. I like the camera and the Blue Shade ability. I like to read before bed and the color really does help me wind down. Long lasting battery! Got this Fire tablet for my youngest daughter for Christmas and she loves it. I also love the option to restrict apps and content for her age! I bought two of these Amazon Fire HD tablets in December as Christmas gifts. Both recipients are happy with these as gifts. I plan to purchase one in the near future for myself. Biting as a gift, my only concern was the size and the Amazon interface. It was easy enough to download the Google play store, so it was familiar to the user. Size was an initial concern, but it was just right to watch movies without being so cumbersome. My son really likes the larger screen to play games. Very easy to use and has so much to offer for the low price. great product, easy to use, love the lighted pad, ease of down loading books, They were using them on Christmas morning!! It didn\\'t take them long too be getting the best from those tablets So I think I would have rated 5 stars however when I got my tablet home my 8 year old used it for a total of 2hrs...the next day it had a reboot screen similar to Dos windows. Excellent customer service at store allowed me to exchange next day. No problems with the second one. Great tablet for the price. i love it amazon is nice read book on it play games on it I bought this Kindle as a gift for my mother so she could access her Facebook account easily. She loves the ease of using it. I have 3 kindle tablets in my home and they are used daily. My mother uses hers for email and some light gaming and for watching Netflix as well. Very satisfied. I wanted a low cost internet device to feed internet radio choices into my stereo. This fit the bill well. I use the headphone jack to connect with my stereo and get great sound. I don\\'t use most of the other apps that come on the device. The Kindle Fire is a wonderful, small device to use for a multitude of tasks. We use it mostly as an ereader and has been so simple to use. So happy we chose this one. It is lightweight and convenient to take with you. I bought this as a temporary replacement for my wife\\'s 11\" Kindle Fire HD that was out for service. She liked this 8\" model so much that she continued using it after the 11\" one returned. I tested this item before I gave it as a gift. It is simple enough for the needs of browsing, social media and entertainment. Definitely best price for simple needs compared to spending $100s on an iPad This feels like an affordable tablet. While not the best in class, it isn\\'t priced to be that either. Works well. Happy with purchase. Great for watching sports events away from home but within wi fi range. So easy to download and then read. Enjoy reading that I can take anywhere without the heaviness of a book I bought this after subscribing to an Amazon Prime membership. This is a great little tablet at such a low price.. too good of a deal to pass up when it was on sale. It has the ability to talk to Alexa, surf the web, listen to music and read books/magazines (lots of free music and books for Prime members). If ads dont bother you, then this may be a decent device. Purchased this for my kid and it was loaded down with so much spam, it kept loading it up making it slow and laggy. Plus the carrasoul loadout makes it hard to navigate for kids, not very kid friendly! Oh you can pay $15 to remove the ads but it wont remove them all. Buy the samsung, better everything! This is my second Fire, I\\'m upgrading from the 2nd generation 7\" model. Love the screen resolution. Movies and videos are sharp and no pixelating. The camera is a bonus my first version did not have. All together this was a great buy for under $100 on sale. Thank you Best Buy. I would buy it again and have twice over already. I actually bought the kids fire kindle and bought this for my wife, her\\'s was lost and she borrowed my sons kid fire kindle I ended up buying her this again, and would buy it again. I would recommend buying a sd card it fills up fast without out it but it is a lot cheaper to buy the lower GB kindle and then buy a good sd card. This tablet has it all. Amazon offers tons of free apps, hundreds of thousands of free e-books and tons of free games. The tablet is intuitive and intelligent. I seamlessly enjoy streaming my favorite shows and reading articles, books and periodicals. What I love most is that the tablet doesn\\'t place all apps on the device, but uses the users miro SD card instead for up to 200GB of additional storage for a dizzying amount of storage for more games, apps, books and movies that can be downloaded and enjoyed. It also allows the owner to share the device with family members, delegating each member an account personalized and tailored to that individual. There is even an option to create children\\'s accounts--extra bonus. I am able to mirror the content from the tablet onto my Samsung Smart television. I will definitely consider Amazon first and foremost when making any future tablet purchases. It maintains a charge for a good deal of time, alleviating the need to be near an outlet to enjoy using it. I can charge it in the evening and use it for several hours the next day, sometimes two days. No one will ever create a tablet that is more considerate of the owner/end-user. I love to read and this tablet makes it so easy to carry an entire library with me everywhere. I have also become addicted to the free underground games. Bought this 8\" model to use in addition to my current 3 year old Kindle Fire HD (7 inch model). So far I am very pleased with the quality of this unit. The slightly larger screen makes watching movies much better. I didn\\'t want the larger 10\" screen (yet). I purchased this on Black Friday because I could pass on the price. The tablet works great for basic internet needs and great for shopping on Amazon. If I were to purchase another Android Tablet, I will look for something with a little more power since this tablet slows when multi-tasking. I bought this for my son (he\\'s 1.5 years old) so he could play basic toddler games, but I found the tablet to be extremely useful for school with it\\'s large screen and super long battery life. I\\'m waiting for the Surface Pro 5 but this tablet that I got for so cheap is making me second guess paying so much! For basic lecture taking notes and watching Netflix or Hulu and kid games, this can\\'t be beat. The best tablet for the price i use it everyday to watch youtube videos Great purchase for my granddaughter for Christmas. This tablet is perfect for just about anything you could want to do on a tablet. My grandmother enjoys this tablet ... it use as her reader. Great item at great price, MY WIFE LOVES IT AND WONT PUT IT DOWN! great black friday deal for a mediocre tablet. android os though! Wanted a tablet at a cheap price and this item fit the bill. Bought on Black Friday which made the price even better. The screen looks good and the performance for the apps I have used so far have met expectations. I mainly used for surfing the web, youtube, and netflix. This device handles each with ease. Overall, I am satisfied with this device. Works well; no issues with reboots or system hangs.. Good size - not too big and not too small. Screen is good for reading. Battery life is good, I\\'ve bought a few books from Amazon but mostly side-loaded books from the library onto a 32 GB micro sd card. Though I have got it for cheap price during black friday, this Fire is not that great. Very bad camera and dim screen resolution. Pros:Install Google Play without any hassleVery good book reading option I got this for my son and he loves it! He can play games, watch movies, you tube videos, and use the internet for help with homework. He also loves all the books, and aps. Was a great black Friday deal should have gotten one for myself. I got it at a great price. They price matched for me. Much faster then getting my laptop out to check email I purchased this product for my youngest son! He loved the color and the size. The storage is great for the number of activities that he has downloaded! Was looking for a tablet to run my remote music server with from my easy chair. My first tablet I bought at about the same price ran through the battery in an hour. Amazon product is much better for battery life and image quality is very nice. This product is easy to use. Screen size is great. Would recommend to anyone. I got it for my kid and she loves it. The amazon free time and prime well worth the money Best tablet around, cheaper than most and does just as much as other tablets. Great buy, it works perfect! Battery lasts a few days too. She likes to read books and this is a fast and cheap way for her to do so It\\'s a great buy. Just to read emails and go on the web Great Christmas gifts for the kids. Hours of fun and games. I purchased this tablet mostly for entertainment. I enjoy playing games and this tablet is great for that purpose. Also plan on using it for reading electronic books. Very nice quality product. East to set up and use. So much more screen size than previously kindles. Fast charging. Longer battery life. Purchased for my mom to read ebooks, great performance, screen looks good, easy to use. Very happy with this purchase. less expensive than last year with so many more features and bigger screen! Bought for my wife for X-mas and she loves it. Hasn\\'t put it down This is a good product for video, surfing and reading. However this version has dropped all android support as far as I can tell. I have a couple of apps that run on my old Fire just fine but are extremely problematic on this one. There is one app I use everyday but it doesn\\'t work on this new Fire, so I have to keep the old one around. Kind of inconvenient. I would recommend seeing if your app is supported on this Fire before dropping the money. This was a reasonable replacement for a broken tablet. Purchased this tablet for my two year old son. It is easy for him to use and has been surprisingly durable. Would recommend the replacement plan if purchasing for a child. Better and faster than Kindle 7\". Great performance for the price. Love it, easy to operate. Very reasonable price - on sale. Good product. Onboard storage does fill up quickly. Bought as a gift to my dad and he likes it so far. It\\'s fast enough for apps and great for reading Works great but the app store is nothing like that of Apple or Google. Fortunately, you can install many Android apps from 1Mobile. The screen is fabulous and it\\'s great at its roots: making reading books fun. I love this tablet. I know it\\'s not an iPad or any of the big tablets but it does just what I need it to do. I\\'ve had it a few weeks now. I\\'ve downloaded videos, read a few books and played some games. I\\'ve had zero problems so far. I know it\\'s not the best video, but for the price of the tablet I don\\'t expect it to look like my flat screen TV. I\\'m trying not to load too many things to keep it from slowing down. So far so good. Browsing the internet is easy too. I\\'m getting used to the browser and the app store for Amazon. For the price of this tablet it\\'s not too shabby!!! You can do some many things and the best part apps for free on Amazon underground! Works great for my 6 year old. Wanted an inexpensive tablet for himsince he can be pretty rough with things. So far so good, and we love the FreeTime app. Was looking to get an inexpensive tablet that ran Android. The Amazon Fire tablet was a much better value than other similar products. Have been very happy with the tablets durability and quality so far too. Would recommend to anyone looking for a lower-end tablet. Bought 2 for each of our teenagers and they just love it... Very cool reading features and zero buffering while watching Netflix. Good quality product. Clear display and easy to use. My mother, husband, and daughter all enjoy using Fire. It\\'s a great way to stay preoccupied. Out of all the tablet choices out there we buy these for our children over any other. You can\\'t beat the price and durability. very good product and right on the cost! Great gift for the holidays. Purchased this for reading and the price. Good value for money. Great for reading, game playing, searching the web and social media. I really like the Fire IS 8 16gb, it is fast and smooth. Does everything a regular tablet can and for the price you really can\\'t beat it This is so easy to use and does exactly what I hoped. Great tablet for streaming ! good internet connection along with a nice display Bought it as an e-reader. Convenient and easy to use. Text is very readable. I am pleased. This is a nice little tablet for the $60 I paid on black Friday. At the regular price I would probably have gone with something a little less restricted and without so much Amazon content. The lock screen ads aren\\'t much of a problem, I understand Amazon sells these cheap and gets it back via ads, but the 15-20 Amazon apps are a little much. It would be easier to stomach if you could add the ones you want or remove the ones you don\\'t. That said, I was able to install the Google Play store and this tablet does everything I need it to do. Overall, I\\'m pretty happy with the purchase. It\\'s a nice new toy. One note: In the online photos the magenta looks purple. It\\'s actually pink. If you like purple, get a black one and a purple case. So cool after playing with this for a while now I would never spend the money on an apple for what I am doing with it. Love the new fire hd 8. Price is amazing and if you are an amazon prime mbr its even better! Great for the kids as you can lock their profiles to a kids mode and they can\\'t buy anything. If i had one downfall its the smaller amount of apps available than apple or google play. Had the Fire HD 7\" before and just wanted to upgrade. Loving it so far and really enjoying the bigger screen! The tablet is not for me it is for a Christmas gift This was a great buy for my son. He needed something that he could easily transport and that woudl allow him to access the internet and various forms of media. This was a perfect choice since he also has a amazon Prime account. This was replacement for my wife\\'s original iPad and broken Kindle Paperwhite. She loves it, as it does basically everything both of the previous devices did in one unit that is easy to use, has good battery life, very nice screen resolution and good size for her. Great value, especially compared to an iPad. for the price this is a great works well the for the price display is hd love it for the money, you will be well pleased, I think it is a big bargain ! I purchased this tablet for my mother, but I set it up and tested it out. It is super fast! I have the original Kindle Fire and all I can say is Amazon has come a long way! The new Fire HD8 is so much better than the original! I like it so much that I am thinking of purchasing one for myself! I would highly recommend this tablet to anyone! I have had a Kindle before, and needed a new one as the old one would no longer charge very well. Still adjusting to some different features from the original one. Do not like the fact that it is difficult to find a case for this one. Very happy with this purchase, it was exactly what I was looking for My original Kindle Fire no longer accepted a charge. I wasn\\'t going to replace it, because I bought an iPad. When I saw the HD8 in a kiosk in a BB store, I realized how much better I liked the size and feel of it for reading books (the iPad is preferred for other things). This Fire\\'s clarity is much improved over my old one, plus it responds better. I don\\'t like that I can\\'t choose a photo for the locked screen - that it HAS to be an advertisement. I also don\\'t like that it usually takes a few trys to unlock. Menial issues from my perspective. It\\'s a good starter tablet, to bad it runs on the Amazon OS. Got this for my sister as a Christmas present and she loved it.Easy to use and great for books. This is my third Kindle, I still have the other two; however, this has a camera and much larger screen. I would take this product any day over a tablet. Look forward to hearing more from my grandkids so far they love it Good small tablet for all purposes for reading, playing games My wife and kids love easy to use and the size is perfect Great tablet for beginners! Very light and screen is wide. Enjoy using for travels. Fast processing great battery reads to me when my eyes bother me. Expandable memory a big plus. The new kindle fire hd is good and my son loves it Got this for my grandmother and she absolutely loves it. She loves to use it to watch Netflix and play games This is just the right size and can put games on it just like an iPad. I wanted a new kindle fir a while. The price was right The display is not as sharp and vivid as they say but still good. Probably better for reading than watching videos. We didn\\'t really get it for the games, but there is a good selection. WiFi works well and internet browsing is fast. The Kindle is a great way to read and watch videos with ease! Exciting tablet still amazed by the ease of use great product all in all Couldn\\'t beat the value for this with the Black Friday price. They aren\\'t the best tablets, but they do a lot for the price. great size,sound and battery. just buy it already. Love the tablet mainly use for games and internet. Grrat product foe the price. She hasn\\'t used the it yet, but my son did a quick check and it seems just fine. I\\'ve had my other Kindle Fire for 5-6 years. It\\'s still working but slowing down. I bought the updated version while it was on sale. I love it! I play games on it, download books, check my email and facebook. It\\'s like a portable mini computer and I wouldn\\'t be without it. I like it better than other people\\'s tablets and you can\\'t beat the price. I bought some for gifts and everybody loves it! I\\'d recommend it to people of all ages. Great product, no complaints at all,good for kids and adults At ninety dollars, the expectionations are low, but this is still a very good table, it\\'s good for light use like watching videos or web browsing, but the camera is a bit lacking, and at certain times the device can freeze or lag. Overall this is a good tablet for $90, I would recommend this to anyone on a budget. Good starter unit. Easy for a beginner to use. Priced low to give you a taste of the tablet world. The Parental Options need some work. You can\\'t even log in to a child account until you have Apps loaded for them to use. Also a kid\\'s login doesn\\'t have access to pre-loaded apps (like the calculator). Seems really odd to me that you can\\'t give them access to basic functionality of the tablet.Otherwise, the tablet itself works great. Bought a Fire HD 8 tablet for my wife. She doesn\\'t like using computers and avoids smartphones, but her new tablet is a big hit. She uses it to play games and to stream movies and radio programs. I use it for everything else -- reading news, checking e-mail, online shopping, etc. It was very easy to set up and even easier to use. Plenty of speed and capacity to do everything we want. We already own kindles so we know they are great ! My son is going to live this! I purchased 2 of these FIre HD tablets as gifts. They pack a lot of punch for the price. I helped set them up so I was able to get an idea of how they are going to work. The screen was very nice and clear. Speed of tablet was good. It is easy to use. If you are already in the Amazon family through prime it is a no-brainer.I don\\'t believe you can get a better tablet at this price point. I bought these as a starter online browser. It is a very portable pad . Great price. Just what my wife wanted and needed she loved it! It is easy to use and simple to set up! Good tablet for the money. A good add on if you have Amazon prime You can\\'t beat the price. Great deal for what you\\'re paying. We bought it for our 9 yr. Old daughter and she loves it. We do as well. Kindle tablets are great! its fast, it has good lighting. its got the 16gb space, best gift ive bought for a bookreader. I love it.....Reading E books here is so easyPerfect for price With a $20 off deal last blackfriday, who will not get it. Much clearer and faster than the other fire HD. Light weight too If you shop on Amazon all the time, this will help make it easier still. Lots of ads pop up, and you can\\'t use apps from non-Amazon sources unless you root it, and that is complicated. This is not a realistic alternative to an iPad or Galaxy Note. If you just want to a device to shop on Amazon with, you\\'ll love it. This is my 2nd Fire tablet. I will alwyas need one. Just wish they lasted longer than 4 years. fire tablet is very powerful for the size and does everything! While there are some apps that are missing due to not using the Google Play Store the list is minimal. The tablet itself is quick, responsive, and noticeable nicer than the 7\" fire. Picked this up when it was on sale for black friday sales. It\\'s great for in front of the TV and catching up on email and light web browsing. Price was fabulous for an entry level tablet. Right on Was impressed how quick and responsive touch and overall speed.Including Alex app.fit in top coat pocket I have been buying Kindles since they first came out. When ever I want to upgrade Kindle is my chosen brand. I am not very tech savvy and I enjoy watching movies, listening to music and primarily reading. I like the ability to purchase narration for my favorite titles and using text-to-speech for the rest. Have not used these yet as they are Christmas gifts Wife loves this thing. She reads nonstop on it. She can\\'t put it down Nice for the price had to put Google play store on myself but still a nice tablet This is a really good tablet for adults but especially great for kids as you can load movies or add apps that they can use. The cost is so low you just can\\'t beat it. Plus, the main feature for me was the Amazon Kindle name on the product which puts it way ahead of the no name tablets on the market. Great product and gift. I purchased two of these on Black Friday. What a great purchase. These are very inexpensive and have the ability to do so many things for the kids. I later bought tough cases to keep any damage minimal. I love my kindle. I bought the larger screen after owning 2 previous 7 inch screens. this tablet has the best battery ive ever seen. The picture is great too. LIke that there are lots of apps to choose from. Very user friendly I wanted a new tablet and saw the 7\" on sale at Christmas, my husband was offered the 8\" for just $10 more, so good value ! Thin and light weight. Easy to start up. I would have liked to have a booklet on featuers and use, etc. Nothing in print came with it other than one paper . Tutorials on set up and where the buttons and slots were. I have enjoyed the quick loading to start, just wish I had a physical booklet on how to\\'s, not just online tutorials. More features In several ways than iPad. This android tablet is really powerful I bought this for my wife because she plays a lot of games along with my grandson, this is perfect to download all the games they want without taking up space on her iPad. Great to take with me when I need alone time to just surf and read. Love the tablet! Easy to use and easy to take with Awesome tablet! Love using it to read and surf the web. It matters what preference you prefer with tablets. I mean if you use windows or google more this might not be for you. For me, I use Amazon music, video, books, and shopping so this tablet is awesome. It\\'s made especially for Amazon ecosystem users. Its light and has a nice feel. I live the blue shade option it has for less blue light when reading. Enjoy having the kindle. My son uses all the time for reading. It has helped him improve in his reading skills. We are glad we bought it. Thank you. This was one of the best birthday presents, I ever purchased for my husband. He said he doesn\\'t use the computer, but he was on my smartphone daily viewing FB. I got him a drone for Christmas and he needed something to view, while it is flying. I researched the Kindle Fire and thought he could practice with it until spring. He farms, so isn\\'t busy in the winter. Thank goodness, because he is busy with his Kindle for hours every day. He thinks it is great and I do too, because now I have my phone back. I really enjoy reading. So much so I was running out of shelf space. I have read a few books with my I-pad mini but it really didn\\'t do the trick. No so with my new Amazon Fire Hd-8. Handy sized, not the least bit heavy and super bright. Add in the face that digital material from magazines to novels are often as not far cheaper that \"hard copies\". Amazing video quality easy to maneuver wonderful screen size easy set up Great tablet other than the photo image quality is fuzzy and not the best. The Fire HD8 strikes an excellent balance between performance and price. It has many of the features you\\'d want in a tablet for a fraction of the cost. Works flawlessly for reading and video streaming. This is my second Kindle and I love it. It\\'s lightweight, simple, and fast. It\\'s convenient for trips and fits in my bag without weighing it down. Bought this as a gift. My mother likes it. It\\'s easy and simple to use. I am loving my fire tablet and I am using it everyday at home and at work on break I will be ordering Amazon fire for my two granddaughters because they love Nana\\'s so much Really beautiful display is great for watching movies and playing games. It is very powerful for the price and you can play lots of games from Amazon for free - they even remove microtransactions from lots of games.Only downside is you need Amazon Prime to get the most out of your tablet Very little set up, Amazon helpful in setting up the functions. Clear pictures and easy to use. Take pictures both ways Graphics are great for the price. Would highly recommend. Bought this for my mom and it was just what she needed and at a great price. Been wanting to get an Ipad for myself, but think this might be a great less expensive option for me as well. The pad worked as I thought but the screen wasn\\'t as vibrant as our iPads. Still a great deal for the price. Perfect thing I needed to read books on and play my games I\\'m loving the tablet so far. I really like the Amazon underground, and the Fire OS just updated, so it has Alexa on it now. :) this tablet is perfect for surfing the internet and following social media I like the shape and size of this Kindle, and the graphics are good. But if I play a game for very long the charge seems to run out pretty quickly. It is very good for books and for music. I would recommend it for those categories. For its price. Amongst the others I felt this was a deal Perfect size and very responsive. I have 4 of them. No issues runs games and internet well. ,,,,,,,,,,,, It is very easy to use for children . We have loved having one and are hoping to buy another one for kids Christmas !! good price for the product. I purchased for my middle school son. not good, hate it , never buy it again, sucks. done Smartphone works on the job for me, but with the Fire I can read instructions and worksheets. It is a useful tool for connecting with both friends and colleagues. 8-inches is the right size for holding in hand and carrying with you. Gives me the information, beats printing everything out, or carrying around a large laptop. Think this will be a great product for my parents it is a Christmas gift. The Amazon fire tablet is an excellent product. I primarily use it to purchase and read books from Kindle. Also, I use it for my Facebook activity. The battery life is long and it recharges quickly. My 10 year old son also enjoys using it. I would highly recommend this product to others. My husband is a truck driver and being on the road away from home, he likes to have shows and movies to watch. This has so much space for him to download things to watch. A great Kindle reader. Easy to order, read and store books. Also speedy for finding Amazon products and ordering them. But the other apps are really slow - too slow. Easy to use as a tablet and easy to use as a ebook reader Not sure if this is due to the new version but I\\'m not able to install or even sideload certain apps onto the tablet. Amazon is really trying to lock out non-Amazon apps namely ones from Google. Aside from that though, performance is already and what you\\'d expect from a tablet in this price range. This was purchased for my mom and it does what\\'s needed and my mom has no complaints thus far. Tablet is working good for what we wanted it to do. Still waiting for Alexa to function. Several calls to Amazon supportled to conflicting answers on how to get it to work, then told it isnot yet available on all Fire HD 8 tablets. The Amazon Fire Hd8 has great features. The size is perfect to carry anywhere. Excellent apps and accessible to books, movies, games etc. Clear screen. it was very quick and easy to setup and begin using. I have had several budget tablet, but this blows them all away. You have to be willing to be invested in the Amazon ecosystem, but it is well worth it. This tablet is a good one for everyday use. It is small but it has a clear image. Not sure if I really wanted one this small but its ok for now. This does not run Android, so no Google Play store. Amazone apps are moztly the same titles, but not all are available that you can get through Google Play. Bought this for our daughter and she enjoys it. If you have an Amazon Prime subscription you can get a lot more out of this tablet as well. Bought for daughter, love the parental control and curfew setting I like the portability of it. I take it with me when I babysit my granddaughter. bought as a gift she loves it great with amazon prime Had the previous version of this tablet and was looking to upgrade. Got this on sale and am very pleased. My daughter love this tablet! Easy to use and carry The best kindle fire ever, love how quickly the apps run, being able to watch movies, listen to music, etc. on it The salesman was very good pointed us in the right direction. The tablets are perfect for our triplet grandsons. Excellent value for the price. Super easy to use and set up. Wonderful display. I love the fact that you can add an sd card for more memory unlike the old Kindles. Plus I\\'m really impressed with the fact the Amazon has such great offers. I love my kindle. It fast, great pict quality and is so convenient to use. I love using it to watch Netflix. It worth the purchase if you don\\'t want to spend so much money. I love this tablet!! Excellent quality speakers and screen. Lots of storage space. Worth the money!! Bought it for my husband and he loves it. This is perfect for what he wanted it for. Very fast and super easy to use I\\'m very pleased with this purchase!! It\\'s works really well and don\\'t have any issues at all Tablet is good for beginners and those that like to read The Kindle Fire has great features for the price. The video quality is asstounding. It worked really well for me as I am unschooled in ipads. I used it while traveling and it was easy to use and did the things I needed, i.e. maps, books downloaded, internet access, youtube, etc.. I don\\'t play games, so cannot comment on that. If you want a tablet to use on a daily basis for facebook or do online purchases you couldn\\'t ask for a better tablet. I use to read books, watch movies, and get online.. it works great and easy to use. I bought this to replace a Samsung Galaxy Tab 3. I absolutely love the Kindle HD 8. It was easy to set up and very easy to find my way around. The only reason I took off 1 star is that I have found some apps are not available for Kindle. But so far from info I have read online there are ways to resolve this issue. Just a simple kindle. Doesn\\'t have the glass back. Throughly enjoying my fire tablet. Can play games and read books. Am very pleased with it. Excellent screen , fast response. Almost a steal for that price. Much harder to work than an android. None of the wallpaper apps I downloaded from the kindle store work on the device. many of the other apps look cheap on the display. other wise it is prettier and more responsive than the cheaper $49 tablet. They make it look like an android tablet but it is not. no google play. Everything is just harder to work than on a regular android BUT for a tablet under $100 it exceeds expectations. It is more responsive than other models of fire Kindle Fire is a dream. Larger screen easy to read I HAVE BEEN WITH AMAZON PRIME FOR 2 YEARS AND THIS NEW FIRE HD MAKES IT WORTH IT. i WATCH MOVIES WHEN I FLY BECAUSE I CAN DOWNLOAD THEM. THE BATTERY LAST FOR DAYS. I USE IT EVERYDAY NOW. Well worth the 80 bucks, especially if you are an Amazon Prime member. You can download and watch anything on there for free, including movies and magazines. The screen is a bit on the darker side, but the battery life is great. I have both an IPAD and this, and I use both. Great when you are waiting for your IPAD to recharge... Reading is easy, can make font as large as you need Improved over the HD 7. Things set up differently but not hard to learn. Also a bit heavier than the 7 so reading in bed a little harder Not to much to complain about. for less than 100 dollars you get an 8in tablet that has pretty good specs; expandable storage, long battery life, great speakers, fast processor, decent cameras and hi def screen. easy to use and well built tablet....The only knock is the included adds but, after using it for awhile you barely notice it. I\\'ve purchased a number of Kindle Fire products for family over the past several years and continue to use them. Easy to use for even my youngest Grandchildren or my 87 year old Mother-In-Law which they use as a reader and for games. An overall good value. This is the fastest booting tablet I have come across. The speed at which I can access sites is really amazing. I went into bestbuy to purchase a replacement after mine died. I loved my kindle, and decided to get 2-in-1 with the fire. It is perfect for my needs. I had fire hdx 8 and loved it, unfortunately got damaged and could not replace. I purchased the fire HD 8 and exchanged n pay difference for fire HD 10. The 8 did not have a lot of options I was used to. :( great product at a great price.i like the builtin filter which is easy on youreyes.probably the best reader under 100 dollars. Very good product. Super quality and the Best Buy store rep explained me about the product This is my third Kindle Fire and it improves each time. Colors are crisper and best of all it stays charged a lot longer. I bought this for my sister, who already had the Kindle 7. For the price the 8 is better. First the obvious. a inch more screen does make a difference and the HD makes reading and streaming alot clearer. Being able to add more storage with a micro SD card is a huge plus as well. This device includes a camera! And last at under 100.00 makes this a huge value for a great tablet. Excellent. Just as good as iPad with a fraction of the price. The Amazon Fire HD8 (2016 model) is a great tablet for the price; however, the Fire OS offers limited abilities to the user. Personally, I wish there were ways to mirror the screen to a tv without having to purchase a Fire TV streaming stick. Also, the inability to use the google play store is a major set back. If it weren\\'t for those two complaint, I\\'d give this tablet 4 stars. I really love the new shape and size of the kindle HD. My daughter uses it and can control it great. I\\'m loving this new fire, mainly because I didn\\'t fork out a couple hundred for it. My only beef is that magazines are formatted for the demensions of an iPad so don\\'t look great on this Love my tablet easy to work and have no problem with down loads.and lite weight. Works okay as a tablet and especially to access Amazon.No good as a general tablet as there are no Google apps available, such as Chrome, gmail, etc. I love this Kindle. I love the fact that you can use an SD card for more storage. Great job The device is priced just right to give as a gift for an 8 year old We have had a hard time with tablets and our 8 year old who has been down loading apps since she was around 3-4 years of age so far this tablet has survived everything except the constant draining of battery when used by her . I believe it depends on how you want to use it. I bought this for my young kids and they are loving it. They can do basic stuff like surf the internet, watch youtube and play some games. The only complaint that I have is that sometimes it does not charge, even if you have have it connected for the whole night. You just have to restart the pad so that it can charge, but that is the only glitch. Works well. I really like the bigger screen (up from the 7\"). Easier to read, just as easier to use if not better. This tablet is great for anyone who uses this for the basics.Load times can be a bit slow for browsing the web or streaming videos, but once it\\'s loaded, it plays without buffering as long as you got internet speeds that are good enough. This tablet is a good size and great for pictures, downloaded videos and music. For its price, it makes a pretty good gift for someone wanting their first tablet. Bought one for the kids to use while we travel, lots of good free games. Installed VLC media player from the app store and filled up the SD drive with movies. Now they are nice and quite for hours on end.Battery life is awesome! Can\\'t beat the value on this. 5 stars even though it has less apps than the play store. I bought my Fire HD8 as an alternative to carrying around my laptop and having to buy many textbooks for college. The fact that I saved well over $150 on one of the 5 books I had to get this semester was a godsend. Most all undergraduate courses I have seen are offered in eBook form for Kindle. If you do not care about having the constant ability of being on the internet without WiFi or other hotspot, it\\'s a great resource. Pros:Price for this was still less than the money saved for my Biology Book.A lot less weight that 5 college textbooks.So far all books I need for college are available as eBooks through Amazon.A single charge can make it through an 8 hour school day.Cons:If you want/need a network connection, you have to use your phone as a hotspot or connect to another WiFi network. Bottom line, I wanted a cheaper alternative to having to lug over $750 in books around. I came out at well under $500 considering I bought this. My only disappointment is the inability to download some of the apps I use in my phone. I had the previous model which was fine for reading but a little slow for other things. The extra .5 RAM makes a difference. Very happy and if you\\'re a Prime member there are lots of freebies! I like this tablet. It has everything you want. However the apps within it need to be updated more often. If this happened than it would be top above an iPad mini. For now, it gives me enough of what I need and in HD. For $89 it was a good deal. Great inexpensive tablet for everyday use. It\\'s not powerful enough for super graphical games but it\\'s great for basic apps like surfing the web, emails, news, etc. Amazon has \"underground\" apps which is totally free (including in-app purchases). Only downside with those is that you sometimes see a full screen ads in them (usually products that\\'s on your Amazon wishlist). All-in-all, it\\'s a great tablet that you don\\'t have to worry about if you break it. Great price of 89 dollars on a great tablet. It is very fast at everything accept game play. For example it plays asphalt 8 and the game is just barely playable. The graphics struggle on this tablet with higher graphic games. Also it is a Amazon tablet with no Google play store but you can load Google play on to it. There are great you tube videos on how to put Google play on a amazon tablet. The screen is good as long as the sun isn\\'t hitting it. The stereo speakers sound great and loud. All in all I really liked the tablet for the price but I really like to play games with good graphic quality. So that being said I did return this tablet and ordered the Nvidia Shield 8 inch tablet through Best Buy for 199 dollars. I got the Shield a week ago and WOW!! What a difference in graphic gaming quality. This thing is just as good as an Xbox1 or ps4. The Nvidia Shield tablet is simply unbelievable for the price of 199 considering the Apple or Samsung tablets that are as fast as this tablet are at least twice the cost. Plus this dubbles as a gaming console for xbox or pc games with 4k out to you tv. The Amazon tablet is also a great tablet for normal usage but if your a gamer like me the Nvidia tablet is the tablet of choice hands down period!! I don\\'t know why bbuy kind of hides the Nvidia tab only on their website and doesn\\'t sell it in the store. If they displayed it in the store. This would outsell the Apple or Samsung tablets. I hope this helps thanks. I find this fire much lighter and very easy to use I use this primarily as a reader; however, it has a smaller number of unread books that are not in the familiar \"carousel\" as in other Kindle readers. As a tablet it is faster, brighter and more clear than other tablets that I have used for internet purposes. I would recommend this product to anyone who uses a tablet or a reader. Does great on browsing and doing research easy to use and love the features especially the private browsing a great price as well Great little tablet for a great price. I keep it at work for listening to music or some lunchtime reading. Wanted to travel without my laptop. Found the Fire to be perfect. Used it mainly for checking email and keeping up with Facebook posts of friends. Found the size of screen to be easy to read. Typing a tad uncomfortable until one has some experience using it. Have yet to use as an ereader. great tablet to replace kindle. Love the features. This is a great tablet for my teen. She loves it and the price can\\'t be beat! This is a great tablet. It has amazing storage. I use mine daily. Great for reading, surfing the web and games. The one small thing I don\\'t like is Amazon prime shows are a bit dark for some reason. Hulu and Netflix work wonderful. The kindle is great to read on. I also like that you can play some games. I love the amazon tablet very much and love to use its good performance and highly recommended to amazon users I bought this for my wife to replace her 7\" fire that was having a hard time holding a charge anymore. She is thrilled! It was easy for her to transfer all of her books and apps from her old fire to this. She mainly uses this for books , email and some games so this is the perfect tablet for her. better graphics and quicker with the 16gb storage If you don\\'t want or need something cheaper than an iPad but of quality, this is a great happy medium.The processor makes for a fluid ride with it. It\\'s speedy. The Android Store gives you good app options and the Amazon ecosphere is everywhere here.The software is a touch buggy but it\\'s still a great deal of a tablet.For a child, for something you want to use casually on a dime, it\\'s recommended. Easy to read. Light in weight. Has many good features. I read about this new 8\" Amazon tablet in the New York Times. My Google Nexus 7, 4 years old, was getting slower and slower, and I needed to upgrade - for as little money as possible.This Amazon Fire 8\" is an excellent value for the money(only $89!) - very fast, great screen resolution, and easy to use. I was skeptical of the Silk browser, which I\\'d never heard of, but it works fine. There is no \"page forward\" arrow, which is odd, only backwards, but I can live with that.It has exceeded my expectations and I\\'m very happy with it. I\\'m not in the Amazon ecosystem, this is my first foray, and it\\'s a good one! Congrats to Amazon for making an affordable, great quality tablet!Also, the purchasing experience at Best Buy was easy and convenient, as always! The new Fire HD 8 is an improvement over the Fire HD 7\". It is faster and the larger screen makes reading books much easier. I do wish the screen was easier to read when outside or in the car. Too much glare in those places. Love it! I\\'m not computer savy but was able to figure out most things without any help. Mother needed something since her tablet had died. Was lot easier for her to learn than her old table. She does lots more with Kindle than she did with tablet Light to carry and good picture quality. This was purchased for a hearing impaired person to download video in American Sign Language . This product was easy to maneuver for someone that was not use to a tablet. I love this tablet. I purchased them for gift and am so glad I did! The new Fire HD 8 tablet is a nice upgrade over the previous version. Storage doubled to 16 GB and the RAM increased by 50% to 1.5 GB. This makes the tablet faster and more responsive. With the improved battery life and much lower price, this is a great general purpose tablet. I purchased it for my dad (70)He needed something easy to use. He really enjoys it. It a great product..,. The quality is awesome the pictures is good and clear... i have had not issues with my purchase. i found a great cover for it on line on amazon and use it every night. thank you for your service. This has a great picture, good size, lots of storage and a camera. Would recommend I went from the 7 inch Kindle to the 8 and it really made a difference. Easier to read and clearer than my old one. I love this Tablet. It\\'s easy to use, a great price & lightweight. This is my second Kindle Fire HD. I was satisfied with the first one, but now I\\'m really enjoying the larger screen. My biggest need is to preserve the progress I\\'ve made in various games without having to replay them, but at least I have access to all my books, movies and games. Love the Kindle! Love the product. I use it every day for Web,Games and reading. I bought this to replace my wife\\'s (1st generation) Kindle Fire. She likes it even better than the old one, especially the pinsharp screen. Great Kindle fire, works great for reading, playing games, etc. Highly recommend to everyone. Very pleased with this device. Great price, easy to use, and light weight. Nice upgrade from my old kindle. I like it very much. For the price this is perfect. I read books, search the web, watch Netflix. It\\'s not an iPad but for the price it is amazing! İt is cheap tablet option coming from amazon. Latest model will satisfy your needs Very descent for a non-IPAD. Good speakers. Great price. The screen is a little dark. Great buy if you have Amazon Prime since you can download stuff and watch it offline (great for trips, etc...). Overall great cheap IPAD or even as a back-up tablet. Terrific battery life too. This thing looks nice, runs nice and feels nice and for the price I don\\'t think you can find a better tablet. Got this for my 9 year old after her ipad crashed and burned. She does not like androids at all but I couldn\\'t afford a expensive tablet for her. So we took a chance with this one. She is pleased and I\\'m pleased it seems so sturdy , not cheap quality at all. Going to get our youngest child one now. Very pleased. The quality of display is better than expected for the price. (Keep in mind that this is not an iPad!). Apps from amazon are well integrated and the functionality is fully enjoyable without limitation. Very satisfied with the product. This review is for Fire HD 8, 16 GB. I like it but I had a hard time figuring things out.Do I get to talk to geek squad free? Can I come down to the store and get someone to help me with my questions.Will there be a fee for that service? Beautiful HD resolution on this tablet. Love the 8\" size, not too big nor too small. This is an awesome tablet, fast, great display and has all the apps I need for personal entertainment If you look for a great tablet for entertainment this is the best you can have, if you want a tablet for working applications this is not the one so be aware and buy this tablet if you want tons of entertainment. also it have a larger processor and internal memory and the external memory to keep all your photos is unbelievable I strongly recommend it, again, not for work but for entertainment. I bought 2, 1 for each kid. Easy to set up and figure iut. I went with the staff member\\'s recommendation and I am so glad I did. I love the internet safety organ on it through Amazon. $2.50 a month per kid for unlimited age related and child safe Internet access and movies, books, games and apps and I can set the time it shuts off and a minimum time for them to read each day. Love love love. Good tablet, great price, easy to use, pick up simple Very happy with my kindle. Would buy it for my kids I am a power user; there\\'s no other way of putting it. I work in IT and I research the heck out of products before I buy. I had an iPad Mini 2 that was just not up to snuff with iOS 10 so I sold it and bought (and eventually returned) the 2016 Fire HD 8. First let me say it\\'s a great tablet for the price and for probably 50-60% of tablet users who surf the web and watch Netflix. It also helps if you are a heavy Amazon content user. For me, I was spoiled by the retina display on the iPad. The 720p display is alright, but you can see the pixels. 189ppi is pretty low by today\\'s standards. The other big thing for me was the lack of a laminated display. It\\'s glare city on this thing. Display nitpicks aside, it punches above its price point. If you don\\'t play really heavy games (which it even plays Titan Quest surprisingly well!) and you don\\'t mind not having an absolutely beautiful screen I think it runs and works fine. It just wasn\\'t for me. I bit the bullet and went with a 128GB iPad Air 2 as its on special at BB for super cheap right now. This is not a bad product. Amazon offers greats products but this tablet was missing features even for a basic tablet. The lack of google chrome compatibility made this tablet not right for me. So I got my Fire HD 8 originally for ebooks since e-copies are much cheaper. Very easy to use, especially if you are not tech friendly. So glad I got this. This was a good tablet. I bought it for my Gf who basically only wanted it for Netflix and YouTube. The display was good, not great. The issue we had was that it kept dropping the wifi connection. This could have been a defect in this one tablet but we returned it and got another one. Bought the Kindle for my daughter. It\\'s the 4th we have bought over the years, one for each child. Great product GREAT value for the cost - not as fast as a high end tablet, but certainly faster than I was expecting. Clear viewing and easy navigation Husband loves the 8\" tablet. The screen is big enough to view what he is reading For first tablet I am pleased. An amazon name is good value. Excellent price point for my basic requirements. It has all the features I need for comfortable reading of online novels and articles. This is a good product for the price. Many more things can be done with this fire 8 than we dreamed about. Easy access to my Amazon account. Easy to set up and use. This item has a very nice readout, and is well built as far as I can tell. The overall size is very suitable, and the price was reasonable. I get great service at Best Buy every time I shop there. Does everything I needed and moreI use it as a travel companion and the size is great. Its so perfect for my niece & she loves it. Going to get another one for my son. the performance is so much faster than my old one and the graphics are much better too. Love my kindle it does everything I wanted I to do. I wanted a tablet that was easy to use that I could access my email, internet and stream shows/movies! It\\'s perfect! As expected. I am very happy with this. This serves the purpose Handy to use and size is good. It\\'s light weight and that\\'s important. I got this for my husband birthday and he loves it This kindle is great. Battery lasts much longer than old kindle. Where do I begin...good clarity, I love the size and storage capacity! Very affordable, love watching Netflix on it. I do wish I could have gotten the purple, got the color black, but overall I\\'m very happy with my purchase. I didn\\'t think to much of it at first glad at the store, I decided to purchase it. IT WAS THE BEST DECISION EVER MADE I bought the Fire HD 8 & CaseI use it mostly for class..works very good..would be better if it had BlueTooth. We have several kindles and this is the latest version. Its packed with Amazon marketing stuff which is fine if you use them but most just take up space for us. This new version comes with 16gb but allows you to expand the memory with an sd card which is great. One problem if you have a few other kindles is that they are linked to your account so if they are for different family members/kids they may end up with the same stuff on them. My kids mainly use them for game apps and YouTube videos which am seem to work great. The sound is good and the hd video is nice. Overall happy with it and the price was good for this type of tablet. I went into Best But to buy another reader but ended up buying a Fire 8; good value and has the things I need in a reader. Got the tablet for my grandson he\\'s happy with it and use it as we speak We bought this earlier on line from another vendor and it was never delivered. Best Buy was great. Great buy. Bought it for my 10 year old niece. She loves it. I have always gone to buy a kindle because I like the books and th games available. But I found them very unpredictable and unreliable. The color burns futon screen, then the screens starts jumping. As a result I have purchased 8 over the years. Not sure if Want to go through that for the 9th time! It\\'s good, saves using up data usage on computer. I use it to keep up to date with the news. The Kindle Fire HD has a larger screen (8\" vs. 7\") and images are crisper with more vibrant colors. Just lock the card out and let the kids go crazy!! This is an awesome tablet perfectly for watch tv for my little nephew My kids enjoy reading books and playing games on the fire tablet. I\\'m so glad i brought this because it is very handy and easy to use too. Everything about it is good and I really like it. At the price it is almost an impulse buy. I wanted a tablet for an upcoming trip to watch some movies, read, etc and this was at a price point that made the decision really easy. If you are used to an iPad, the Fire HD is a little disappointing but it costs considerably less. It fit my needs but I felt some slugginess and several instances of needing to reboot to get certain apps to work correct. If you go in with the understanding this isn\\'t an iPad replacement this should fit the bills for you. Let\\'s just say, after my trip I purchased an iPad Pro and this item will likely be handed off to one of my children. If you have Amazon Prime, you do get some nice perks that make this a really nice item. Easy to follow directions allowed her to set it up with me watching over her shoulder. I purchased this tablet for my Autistic child. He loves it!! I\\'ve enjoyed using my Fire HD8 tablet to play games. Beautiful screen, vibrant color, fast and best quality for the money. I use it for downloading and reading books. It is the perfect size for this purpose. It is also very light. Bought for wife who is not into the techie word. She likes it - suggest buying a protective screen and padded case for it. My wife wanted an iPad. I bought her this because it was cheaper and good for reading and playing games. She uses iOS products so it\\'s not compatible. She hardly ever uses it. Next time I\\'ll get what she wants and not waste my money. Much better screen resolution than my 7 inch fire. I bought this tablet for my Mom and she loves it. I used it myself and it\\'s very easy to use and works nicely with Amazon Prime, etc. definitely would recommend especially for the price. I enjoy using the tablet. I use it when I am biking. This really a nice tablet.It runs great and it\\'s thin and easy to hold. This tablet is quick and as good as my iPad! I use the tablet specifically for one aspect of my life and it performs great! I am pleasantly surprised by its performance! I have a 4 year old boy and 6 year old girl and 12 year old boy no cracks or broken yet yes they have dropped them no case but no cracks yet pretty amazing when they drop it on hard wood floors and still not broke!! Wow I\\'ve had quite a few different kindles over the years and I\\'ve loved all of them. But this kindle fire hd 8 is by far my favorite. So glad my husband bought it for me the best purchase ever. Upgraded from a standard Fire tablet. Better screen, a bit faster than standard Fire. In my opinion this the absolute best value on a tablet out there. No way to go wrong at this price the new sound and the faster speed plus other improvments are great I am very happy with this Amazon tablet. I purchased it for business purposes, as well as recreational, and it works great for both. I did get an SD card for more memory. Also, if I would have bought directly from Amazon, there would\\'ve been a 1 month wait. However, I was able to order from Best Buy online, and pick it up that very day!!! Its perfect to see my tv series when i don\\'t have my tv around. It has a very good resolution quality. I bought the 8\" to replace my old 7\". I love the bigger screen Freeze frequently... No way to trouble shoot or repair it... I got myself 1 of these tablets and so far I love the way it works You can enlarge the print and change the lighting to make it easier to read. The only thing with it is you must have an Amazon account to use it. This kindle rocks! Tons of storage at an awesome price. bought it as a gift for my mother and she loves it I love the fire....it works great and the navigation through the Fire is user friendly too. I think the 8 is the better buy for your money. BY FAR THE BEST TABLET IVE EVER OWNED, EASY AND QUICK SET UP This tablet is very good especially considering the price. also has memory slot to increase storage. I bought this tablet over the holidays when it was on sale. It has been a great tablet. The battery life is great on these new models. Also playing games everything moves smoothly since it has more ram. The durability of the tablet is great. This thing won\\'t break if you drop it. The only thing I don\\'t like is the fire os. You can\\'t get everything you can get on the google store so not all apps are available. I have had a few kindle\\'s in the past so this was nothing new for me but what I loved about this one is that the screen is big so when I am reading a book it\\'s a lot easier than when I had the first kindle screen. I mostly use it just for the reading but being able to navigate the internet on it is great for when I want to look something up about the book real quick or if you want to search reviews on a book before purchasing. I love it! Purchase this tablet during the Christmas sale. This tablet is a good tablet for a beginner. Easy to use and shows movies and videos very well. Great tablet for on the go. Good size screen to watch movies or read book. Light, portable and great features. Highly recommended. For the price and features offered on the tablet, I wouldn\\'t purchase any other tablet. I enjoy using it and overall find it fairly easy to navigate. Easy internet browser with \"Silk\" and convenient access to all the applications I am interested in. Bought it for a friend he likes it.would recommend it. This tablet was everything I was looking for: a cheap tablet that could download Netflix shows for offline viewing Unlike my first Kindle, this tablet gives me all kinds of information, advertisements and offers when I first turn it on. I could live without that, but overall, I am pleased with this new tablet. It does many things I haven\\'t taken the time to explore, but hope to soon. This is a great tablet for the price. Would give it 5 stars if it had included some sort of instruction manual. Otherwise, definitely recommend. This is a great tablet with great features. I love my kindle. Can\\'t beat the price on this tablet! Great for streaming or casual games. Great for reading and Netflix. Fits nice in purse. Good price. Good value at a very affordable price. Can\\'t beat it. Works great prety fast operating system dosent heat up We love this so much in our home. We bought a super tough case and let our two and six year old use it. They love watching their movies on it and playing different apps. It is a really good value! Great tablet! Brought this for my wife and she loves reading off of it! Great price, easy to use! Great purchase! Very fast, very functional. Love the e-reader function. Movies, music and internet work great. LOVE IT! I received this as a gift from my husband. It\\'s great for reading, gaming and watching Netflix. I exchanged a highly unsatisfactory Insignia unit for the Fire. I was looking for a 10 inch screen, but went to the smaller size for performance. I have no complaints with the Amazon product, other than the ubiquitous advertising. My daughter loves her tablet. I had to make sure I brought a case because it is very thin. No problems and I can see everything she downloads Have a fire 7 and wanted a bigger screen, love the new one. Perfect for our needs and an on the go mini computer and ereader. This tablet is great for books, audible books, music and all things Amazon. The included browser (Silk) is not the best. I purchased expanded memory (64GB SD card) for about $30 more and a cover for about $20. The biggest issue I have with this unit is that it is slow (when compared to an iPad) and it tends to freeze every so often. For about 2.5x more money, consider an iPad instead. Great tablet use it for reading and email. Great price! Nice little tablet. Functional and easy to use.Fits the needs that I need to use it for. Awesome.and repeat 50 times. That should do it. Blah. I initially bought the tablet for school, I use Kindle to rent books but after using it to stream Xfinity, Netflix, and Amazon Prime I loved the sound and picture quality. I would recommend this to anyone needing a good low cost tablet with great battery life. We have had no issues with this tablet. Love it!TY For the price it\\'s a bargain. This is a perfect solution for a reader and simple browsing. I use this at night before bed. My first tablet experience and it\\'s awesome. I love being able to stream movies and have numerous apps at my fingertips. Bought this for my wife and she loves it! This was our third kindle over a period of many years\\'Can\\'t go wrong for the price. Love this tablet. Power lasts long. Short charge time. HD screen is really clear. Only con is that there are some apps not available like Google play. Very satified. Have a 128gb card in mine . Plenty of space for downloads. The camera has no flash and is not the best but I didnt buy this tablet for that. High recommend the HD tablet 8gb amazon fire. You want go wrong. This tablet does all the things I really need. I have it some thought before buying I don use most of the features a more expensive computer/tablet has. Have been very happy with my purchase. Got this for my wife\\'s birthday. She had an older model and wanted an upgrade. She seems very happy with it and uses it every day Very user friendly...long lasting battery....very clear display Worse graphics, won\\'t keep a wireless connection,overall not satisfied Easy to transfer my stuff from my old Kindle into this new one. Love the price and how easy it is to use. Great buy. This is my first kindle. It works great for my use. Mostly reading, email, and Amazon shopping. Amazon Fire HD8 is one of the best deal at 89$. Strong, efficient, low price and some Amazon features that I love. Youtube videos of how to get googleplay and android apps have made things lot more easier. And now, microsoft office is available online for free that I can access and edit my documents. What else do I need? Amazon is more respectable brand name than other low price brands or used/old models of high price brands. Definitely recommend it. I held off getting a tablet and wish I had done it sooner. The Amazon Fire 8 is great and easy to use i have been looking at tablets for a long time, most of them a little expensive for what i would use it for. This tablet lets me read, email, searches and the best part I can buy books through amazon and not have to carry heavy books with me when i travel Not the highest quality of tablet out there, but for the price you almost can\\'t beat it, especially if you are an Amazon Prime member. I liked the screen size and easy to read books at night. The battery has a long life. The outer rcase could be stronger because concerned about durability. Works great for everything we want our daughter to do it\\'s wonderful. I love it. It\\'s easy to watch movies, play games and read books. love it just like my other one just better!!! since I already own a kindle I knew this was what I wanted. Just needed a second one and a little bigger. Always loved the service and help I get at BB so I knew I would purchase it there!! Found salesman to be knowledgeable and most helpful. Thanks so much for your help and service New Kindle replaced my old Kindle that had a lot of books. To my surprise the book transfer worked well. Seems to work surfing the net. Music sound is only okay. Great little device that does almost everything a Tablet does. I use it as my computer when I travel as well as a reader. Has meet all my needs plus some. Recommend you buy a good stylus pen at the same time. It fits just right in your hand. Light weight. Love it I extremely happy with my purchase. I like that the screen is just a little bigger and much faster. Good picture, works well, great variety of apps. keep in mind that you get apps from amazon, not google play, so they aren\\'t always the same or same price This replaced my old Kindle Fire. I have not yet explored all of the features but, so far, it is performing very well. Tablet is a good size and weight, and easy to use. This tablet has been the best one for the price we have purchased 3 other tabs for our kids and they have all broke and ran super slow they love them would definitely recommend this to anyone who wants to save a buck but want quality I would recommend this product it is a good tablet to use have had no problems. Kids love it, under $100 so the price is great. Don\\'t have to worry about it getting mishandled as much. Still can\\'t get them off the ipad though. I went with this tablet based on many good customer reviews, but my experience was not a good one. From the start I was on the phone every day for at least an hour with Amazon tech support for one issue or another. Most of the techs were very polite, but not all knew the product very well. At one point I asked one of them about trying to save some RAM and they kept referring me to the storage, which told me they didn\\'t even know the difference between RAM and regular storage. The internet browser was basic and it ran very slow at times, even when all my other wifi devices ran great. Then a day would pass and I\\'d be trying to type an email and the keyboard would just stop working...wtf??? Come to find out it\\'s a \"known issue\" and \"they\\'re working on it\". After two weeks of one thing after another I got fed up and just returned it. I wanted it to work, and gave it a good run, but just not quality stuff. To me it was like Walmart trying to build their own computer when they\\'re obviously not a computer manufacturer, neither is Amazon. If I were you I\\'d look at a regular Android tablet from a reputable PC manufacturer, which is exactly what I did next. I got an ASUS tablet for only a few dollars more, and it\\'s unbelievable. 1000% better in comparison to the Amazon Fire HD8. Save yourself the aggravation and go with ASUS or some other company that is specifically in the computer business full time. Sorry Amazon, not this time! Not very fancy, but not slow. If you have Amazon Prime, you have a access to a great library of TV shows and Movies for free. Same goes for free book rentals. The Amazon App store is not so great, lots of apps are outdated but still work. Just not the latest versions you would expect. But the Amazon Underground appstore does offer free access to games you would normally pay for. It\\'s decent for it\\'s price and a good deal if you don\\'t want anything fancy. I love my Kindle fire. Had a Kindle and it disappeared. Enjoy not having to go to library for books. I get a great selection of books every day. Light weight and easy to use. Very user-friendly. Durable. For the price the tablet can not be beat. I use this over my ipads that i have. There is nothing i cant do with this tablet I recently upgraded to this tablet; it is everything I wanted. Highly recommend! It was a good buy and tried this for a day. It was fast and experience was good. I purchased this tablet knowing exactly what my needs were and how well the Kindle could meet them. Despite the \"walled garden\" philosophy that tethers you mostly to Amazon products and services, the ability (as of right now) to side-load the Google Play Store makes this a surprisingly versatile device for the price point. This is a great tablet for the price! I bought it to replace my iPad mini. Great for ereading and general browsing. This replaced a Kindle 7 HDX with 32GB of ram. The older tablet had a charging port that wasn\\'t functioning anymore. Had the Geek Squad warranty so they issued a full credit for the old tablet and my son chose the HD8 as his new tablet. Other than the screen resolution being lower and less memory, great tablet. My son didn\\'t care about the resolution and the new Kindles let you pop in an SD card for more storage. Popped in a 64GB SD card and he\\'s a happy camper now.. ;) I purchased this as a gift but have had extensive time with it. It\\'s a great budget tablet, phenomenal screen and a very smooth interface. Handles all apps and HD content well. This was a birthday gift to my husband. He really likes it and it does what he needs it to do I \"retired\" an earlier version and this new souped up model more than meets my needs, and the battery lasts so much longer!! I have a kindle and wanted more options. I love the bigger screen. I find it easy to read. It can have some reflection under lights but not much. This tablet is easy to set up, has great resolution, and is perfect for reading books or surfing. The price is affordable, too. It is perfect for anyone who wants a fun and casual way to use technology. This was bought to replace my old Kindle with keypad, and experimental internet. Was surprised how much the Kindle had changed, and at the same price as my old one was when I bought it!Have already shown it to a couple of friends who now say they are thinking about getting one. Really enjoying my new tablet. I like to travel and me and my family use it to play game and watch movies. Just the right size to. Liked this Kindle upgrade. The color screen and backlights allowed for easy night use I enjoy the new kindle, only things I would like to change is the way screen darkens and lightens while reading. Not sure how to stop that. Occurs consistently. Also, would like to stop the ads seen each and every time kindle is turned on to start reading again. That is bothersome. Otherwise, am happy with the kindle. I purchased the 8 inch device. Also purchased black cover.I played for it and asked if I could get it set up and was told it would be 40 more dollars. I did not have 40 more dollars so I left the store with my kindle and had someone else set it up for free. I was disappointed I had to get someone else to set up my kindle. My previous Kindle was dying and I wanted a new replacement fast. I went to Amazon and while they had one it was back ordered a month. Expecting to pay more I went to Best Buy and not only found it for the same price but even better it was available at my local store and I could pick it up the same day! I got this for my son to play games on soI could get my iPad back. Personally I think it\\'s a great little tablet for kids and or for reading. Other then that it\\'s not a high powered game playing tablet or anything to keep lots of storage on. But it works for what it\\'s intended for andI have no problems. Easy to use You cant beat it for the price you pay This Kindle is larger than my old one and book reading is much easier. Some features I don\\'t use so can\\'t comment on them. All in all I love it.The only drawback was that the store had no covers that fit this Kindle. We purchased this as a replacement for our now-broken iPad. Though we liked the smaller size (more convenient, easier to carry, etc), the internet was sooooooo slowwwwww that it drove us crazy. Sometimes minutes to download a site (and this with no other apps open!1). Plan to go back to another iPad. Tablet is great and easy to use thankfully because its my 1st tablet This is an item that is easy to use for novices. My child uses it and has no issues Easy to use. Pretty user friendly. It is good value for the price No problems with tablet, kids love it and the size is great My nephews love to play with my phone. Now as anyone who has been around small humans knows they have an astounding ability to perpetually have something sticky on their hands. However, if its a rare case where they don\\'t they will probably drop the device from the lack of said stickum. The kindel has come to my rescue as it has everything they need to be entertained. And best of all it lacks the anxiety inducing price tag for that moment when the kids demonstrate Murphy\\'s law in action. Was a present for my 14 year old grandson. He was very pleased. The Kindle fits me to a \"T\". Very quick to start. It shows how to get things done. For under $100 this 8\" tablet is a bargain. I do all I want on it like; check email, Facebook, Twitter, watch YouTube, read books, and shop on eBay or Amazon. I\\'ve been very pleased with my purchase. Bought this for my wife for our anniversary she loves it I love to read and this tablet work great for my needs. I know beforehand that this is not a powerful tablet. But it\\'s the best bargain at this price point . The screen is okay if you just read books, news, or surf the websites. But if you want to enjoy videos-this is not your choice.The processor is slow and the amazon app store doesn\\'t have all the apps like you\\'d expect from Google appstore- even though the OS based on android. But few tweaks let you install the Google playstore-search online for the steps.Overall I\\'m satisfied with my purchase. Hope this is helpful. I bought it for my grand daughter, she knew how to use it right away. You can purchase a rubber case in different colors for protection. It is just an average tablet. Bit slow but is a good option for people on budget Very nice for reading and watching videos. Strong wi fi is a must. Slippery to hold so buy a cover Tablet stopped working after owning for two weeks. Came back on after an hour. This device is great for the price! I use it for my daughter and after having seeing the ads on amazon, I thought this would perfect for her. I think that the Amazon Kindle tablet was a great purchase for my teenage daughter and grandson, very easy to operate. It kept them entertained for hours while we were traveling on the train for vacation. Great device. Works very well and use it throughout the day.Keeps me informed and great for looking up things and staying in contact. I love my kindle, I can listen to music,read my emails, or pick a book to read. Everything loads up easily. I really enjoy my new kindle, still getting used to it. I have done this like 5 times now. Don\\'t send me this ahs8n. Getting aggravating. This is an affordable tablet and works well, you just have to deal with a lot of advertising. Love how I am able to run the latest Minecraft on this device, but am not able to on a 3-year-old iPad. It seems as apple handy cap their devices. Resolution may not be the best, but for the little buggers it works fine I love my Fire HD8 I got it because my Kindle(the original) that my husband bought me died and the Verizon Tablet wasn\\'t working great for me. So I came down and the agent at store showed me this one, there is a learning curve but it gets better and takes a while to learn but I love it. Does all the basic stuff I need at a great price. I use it for some apps, web browsing and some video. Picked this over the Fire 7\" for the screen size, resolution and CPU/GPU. Battery life is pretty good. Ads aren\\'t too annoying.Far cheaper than competing name-brand budget tablets while doing almost everything needed at this level and probably better supported. FireOS will always be a little behind the current Android version and I\\'d rather have Google Play than Amazon, but this still allows for side-loading stuff.Recommend if you\\'re ok with living in Amazon\\'s world and/or proficient enough to load other app stores or packages (or know somebody can). this item work just as I expected it to, great product! This is the third Fire we\\'ve purchased, and Amazon finally made this level memory-upgradable. That has made all the difference. I bought Fire tablets for use as a \\'kid tablets\\', for which they work great...until you run out of memory. 8GB is practically nothing these days (I remember when having 64kb was a HUGE upgrade to my Atari!) so being able to toss in a memory card give my kids much more utility. Have a nook , this is much better has more apps and thru amazon I love the size and the HD quality. Just what I was looking for!Downloads apps really fast! Never thought a tablet at this price could be this good. Totally recommended! This is my sixth unit and has features many of the newer models didn\\'t have. Thank.............................................. I had the original kindle fire for ten years and I loved it. But it broke on me and I decided on this one after looking at all the upgrades from the original. It let\\'s you do so much more, but some of the tutorials (like for the internet) weren\\'t helpful. Lightweight, nice display and not too large to carry. this is the perfect size for an older person who uses it minimally. Good tablet, satisfied. One point annoying...silk browser makes Yahoo email a list and have to tap HTML to read each one...Awkward. I love the apps that are on here and everything else I think it\\'s the perfect tablet for a beginner has all of the apps that you will need Love this tablet. 16GB memory but have expansion slot. Bought 128GB micro SD card for $56. Love this feature I love Amazon Fire HD8... It is so easy to use and perfect for reading books on or cruising Social Media. I love that it has Alexa included on it. I love my Kindle for reading manga and comics. The fact that the graphics are worse than my phone detracts a little from the expirence, but serves to remind me that I cheaped out and bought yesterday\\'s model. This is not a real negative, it just appeares less crisp than my phone. The increased picture size more than makes up for it in my book. This thing lasted not even a month before it went dead. Going to try and take it back Bought this so the grandkids could use it. They already have one at their house. My husband has been using it also & he likes it. He has never used a tablet before but he has enjoyed it. This is a fantastic tablet for the price. This is a great alternative to an IPad. I had an original Kindle that I replaced with this newer one. I love it!! My 8 year old loves this so much to do on it. She enjoys reading on it play games . I purchased this tablet for my 9 year old son and he loves it. Nice bright screen and has two speakers for pretty good sound for a tablet. Great for games and watching videos. This was purchased on Black Friday as an impulse buy and we absolutely love it! It was a great price and the size of the tablet is perfect. It works great! Great little tablet for someone who is always on the go. I love my tablet no regrets the pic are great I recommend it! It\\'s a great item to have when you are out and about. It\\'s easy to connect to Wi-Fi and it\\'s small enough to fit in my purse. Nice product for the price. It does what we need it to do. Easy to use and handy to have with you instead of a heavy laptop. This was a surprise when we opened it up! Bright and colorful!! Nice look. Great memory and camera. For this much money everything is so good. Bought this for my niece for Christmas. She mostly uses as ereader and checking email. I\\'m happy with my purchase is all I can say. The only complaint I have is that the 3.5 mm Jack is right next to the volume button and it gets in the way. Good tablet for the price. Nice display good performance. Loved my first kindle so the upgrade to the new one was practically seamless. This is I think the best product I\\'ve bought. I already own eight that I\\'ve purchased through the years for my family and they seem to only get better and less expensive in price. I have been completely satisfied with this product. The quality of graphics is great and downloads are a breeze. I would definitely recommend this product. I bought this as a present for a friend, and he uses it all the time. The HD screen is crystal clear, and this tablet competes well with the bigger names. My dad is a first time user for anything techie he has really enjoyed it. If you enjoy reading you will not find a better device. Excellent price for a product of this quality Bought this for my great granddaughter for a gift. She loves it and it is easy for her to use Was bought for a Christmas gift. My 11 year old son loves it. A friend of mine was in the market for a new tablet. I had researched the Fire tab for some time and liked the specs, which met her needs. I decided to buy her one for her b day, SHE LOVES IT! Works great with all the Amazon stuff, like Kindle, Alexa, etc. My kid enjoys the tablet. This one is inexpensive than ipad. The availability of apps are limited. I love my kindle, it is what I like to use at the end of the day or for business trips. The only annoying things are the amount of advertising the put on this version. It was only $35 for Christmas so I can\\'t complain. im always using my amazon tablet...perfect for games!!! Great price. Fantastic gift! I would recommend this for a gift for all ages. I love to read! Having the Kindle Fire is like having hundreds of books at my fingertips! Bought this as a Christmas present for my wife. Reads it all the time! Great all around tablet. Color and resolution is very nice. Best price for a nice product. Bought for my son as a birthday gift and as a way to not wear out his laptop. Works great especially for videos and general online use. This was an impulse buy. While getting a bigger, faster and much better tablet for my wife I decided I\\'d get this for myself. It did the job just fine, but after about a week I returned it. I just didn\\'t find myself using it wnough to warrant keeping it. The price is awesome and if you don\\'t mind it being a bit slower than other, much more expensive, tablets then I don\\'t think you can go wrong. I use this all the time. So much better than bringing out the laptop. This tablet is definitely recommended if you are looking for light to medium usage. Tablet is snappy and quick but slarts to lag after installing multiple apps.Amazon app store is good but there are few essential apps that are not available, though you can install them using black market. Nice it all ready has Amazon and apps built in. Great buy. Bought this tablet for my wife and she absolutely loves it. I also use it for school which works great with writing notes directly on PowerPoints So far so good. This is replacing a broken kindle fire. Bought this for my husband. He has really enjoyed it. Great for my son. I monitor school work and apps he downloads. I love my kindles. This is the 4th one. The others I wore out. I enjoy this one the most . Easier researching things , lot more options etc Very good value tablet. Does everything pretty well. Brightness isn\\'t great. Battery takes a while to charge but lasts forever. Decent buy. Would recommend. Really enjoy my kindle. Fits perfect in my purse and the screen is a good size. I bought this for Christmas for my husbandand now I \\'ve had it for months. I am still happy with this purchase. It has a nice screen and is easy to see what you are viewing. I will be buying another one for myself soon. I really like the feel and ease of use. It\\'s a great tablet for the price. This is a great tablet. I was surprised at how efficient and easy to use it is. I bought 8 of these for gifts to make Bible study easier for a bunch of friends. We purchased this for my wife\\'s mother. She likes to play games on it and do some reading. Needed a new Kindle. Wasn\\'t sure what one to choose. This one is GREAT! This product is OK but is not the best you can get. for a sale item fine. battery life seems to be a little short. Bottom line.....So so So far I am extremely satisfied with my purchase. Great product for a great price! I use this while underway and it\\'s a perfect size to travel with Love it. Great gift. Awesome for those who don\\'t have a tablet or never used one Works great with my amazon prime account and for browsing Internet and playing game. Cheap tablet as well. Had it for about a week and now it won\\'t take charge, tried new chargers and still not taking charge. Happy with tablet but unhappy about not chatging Overall I think the Kindle Fire HD is a great product. No complaint so far. I am extremely happy with my purchase. The kindle is very fast and the screen is clear. Great tablet, fast & reliable. Only downfall is having to pay to remove adds. It all of a sudden has stoped charging I have only used it a few times in the short time off purchase. Can I get a replacement or how best can I be helped The Fire HD8 tablet is so easy and fun to use. Take it everywhere. Love that it is easier to see than a cell phone, for those with old eyes. My wife\\'s mom wanted a tablet. This was a great way to get her into technology and she LOVES it. Not iPad or galaxy but good start. I purchased b/c my old kindle fire finally bit it ...screen went dark. Very happy with this one. Cost is great. The screen resolution is great. User friendly. My favorite feature is the SD card so you can add more gb. Bought it for my daughter. Works great Store personnel did an excellent job This is a reliable brand and a good product for price. Our son just LIVES this unit. He has all his favorite games on it. I bought this kindle for the extra size. I have recently been having trouble with seeing clearly so I figured with the size it may be easier. It was and I really like being able to change the color of the fonts and background, it seems to help immensely. Great budget tablet at a great price. Long battery life and high quality display. I traded this in after receiving a 7\" at Christmas and I am happy I did. I love the size of the screen for reading my books (which I have too many of) and a great size for watching movies. I do wish I had the capability to use internet when I am away from home, yet other than that, this is a great buy. Overall I like the Fire HD8 tablet, hard to beat at that price point. Sure the more expensive tablets are faster, brighter, better, but for the money and casual surfing it is just right. Good companion to Prime Membership, wouldn\\'t be half as good without. This is great tablet. Its great for people who don\\'t need a lot of apts. or store a lot on it. Doesn\\'t over heat. Light weight. I was going to get a Samsung tablet but for doing everything this is better amazon tablet is great. no google bloatware. everything is amazon. one thing i didnt like was. ads on the lock screen and no way to turn off. Bought this tablet to replace a 3 year old Galaxy Tab. This tablet is quick and easy to use, relatively streamlined. The screen is nice and the stereo speakers, while tiny, sound better than my old tablet. The modified Android system that Amazon is running on this tablet is good, just a bit restrictive. All in all a good tab for general browsing and popular apps.Pros:-Price-Performance-Feels sturdy-Easy to navigate-Silk browser works greatCons:-Not all apps are supported on here, like Telegram-Ads on lock screen feel unnecessary, but not a hindrance-Not as customizable as other Android tabs I needed to replace my old reader, and found that this model was just as good. if not better, and at a greatly lower price. I have enjoyed using it for about a month, and am very please with it. I didn\\'t expect anything less than what I got with this Kindle. Bought this for my daughter to replace a worn out ipad. She is happier with the size. The resolution is nice. Great buy for the price This tablet could be so much better if the apps actually worked decently. The built in Amazon pieces for Prime members is great and work flawlessly. But it\\'s not enough to overcome the terrible app behavior and countless freezes.  They need to take a lesson or two from Apple. I have only used this a few times so far, but I like it. The lightweight and pretty easy to navigate. Perfect screen size too. I ended up purchasing a second one for my fiancé. The size of this table is great I\\'m able to carry it in my purse with no problem! Really nice customer first service. I have had other Kindle readers before so was familiar with the unit. I bought this tablet mostly for watching movies. I downloaded movies from Netflix and watch them during indoor bike training at the gym. I love the ability to expand the memory with a microSD card, which iPads do not. It\\'s pretty fast and has all the features I need. I read kindle books with it as well. The drawback is that some apps are not compatible with this device. The iPad is definitely more powerful and compatible with many apps I use, but this is a great tablet for most of my current interests. Before the 8 inch kindle we the old 7 inch one, which both tablets are great but this one so much nicer. The screen is bigger, more storage amd Love the color on the back. Great Tablet I\\'m enjoying the longer battery life, faster processing and most of all the ability to expand the memory. Highly Recommended! She loves it . it\\'s the best thing we could of ever brought her Bought this tablet for my son and he has loved it. It\\'s so easy for him to use and easy for me to set parental controls. Nice little tablet for the money. A few ads to deal with. I use it to read books. Have read a lot of books on it. The right size and lighting for any situation. I bought this for my computer loving 89-year-old dad. Now he can check his emails from his chair rather than having to go into his computer room! Bought on Black Friday for $60, add a trifold case, portable TV while I do dishes/cook/anything Got this when it was on sale which is what really made it worth getting. Tablet works well, slim design is perfect. Highly recommended to purchase this tablet. Perfect purchase for me. I take it everywhere and is so easy to use! Purchased this a couple of weeks ago, no complaints so far. Web pages load pretty quickly on the Silk browser, and the battery life is excellent. After installing Google Play Store (it\\'s really easy!) even more apps are available. Can\\'t beat this for under a hundred dollars!!! After having a basic Kindle for 6 years, I moved up. I am thrilled with all this product can do. I am an avid reader. The Fire let\\'s me do that and lots of other things. I am still finding apps, and other things it will do. I know this sounds \"old fashioned\", but it would be great to have a user\\'s manual! Thanks for asking. Bought as a replacement kindle for my mother in law. She loves it perfect size for her. This is my 4 the Kindle and is well worth the price. My wife loves this tablet.Much easier to use than previous 2 tablets that we purchased. It\\'s great!! Light weight! Charges quickly! Great features! Will not seem to charge all the way and this is my 7th Kindlle. Nicer than my old fire. Better screen area to view My husband and I both use this and really love it. We got kindle unlimited for the books but it\\'s also great for playing games and surfing the web too. Love my new Kindle Fire - easy to use - the battery life is amazing!! Perfect size for reading watching movies and carrying on a plane I upgraded from a 7 to an 8 inch. What a difference. Totally satisfied would recommend this to everyone I know and it out performs some of the bigger name brand tablets out there. if you looking for a good video and somewhat customizable tablet at a great price do not pass this up. If you need a basic tablet then the fire works. It falls apart when compared to the iPad mini from a usability, functionality and available apps standpoint. Worked great but after awhile I wouldn\\'t unlock. After I\\'d enter my pin, the screen would go black. I took it to geek squad (luckily I bought the protection plan!) and told me they don\\'t fix them they just replace them. So I got another one but that one did the exact same thing. Ended up returning that one too. seems a lot better, does not have the open cover feature, which I miss, but still getting used to the differences and trying to get my thing back on that I had on the old 1 Really easy to use, nice size, works great, affordable price, extra card slot for storage, bright screen, good speakers, easy to download apps, This is my third Kindle. My sister bought me my first one and I said I didn\\'t need it and probably wouldn\\'t use it. I was so wrong! I use it everyday. When it died, I bought another one and then a third. I can\\'t live without a kindle. I bought the kindle fire 8 for my husband and I to use. Neither one of us have been able to figure out how to use it. Every time we open it advertisements pop up. And we just try buttons to remove it. We cannot get it to rotate for our puzzles. Just too complicated to use and to navigate around. I will be returning it. We have an iPad and it\\'s much easier. bought this for my niece and it works perfect, she easily navigates all menus and features... An inexpensive tablet that can satisfy your reading and viewing pleasure. Fast and good quality product. Recommended! Bought this for my 2 yr old. Easy to use. Good parental controls. As long as you\\'re not comparing it directly to an iPad, then it\\'s a pretty good tablet for the $$ like it at first, but it is going slow sometimes. overall good product We bought the tablet for our kid and it actually is good for her. Great little tablet to take with you, great for kids Only problem is that it is impossible to read or do anything on the KindleFire with any light in the room at all; far worse than impossible in sunlight. There should be some sort of temporary screen or other add-on that can be used with the device when in sunny or bright locations. I like this and the price is right enjoying it now I Bought this as a gift for my daughter! She is diabetic and losing her vision. I am hoping the large text will be easier for her to see so she keeps reading. I have ordered a couple of these for my family members and say that they work great and do everything that they are supposed too. Highly recommend. I have a nexus 9 but it is painstakingly slow so I wanted something that does not lag Everytime I try to use the browser and does not freeze whilst playing games and this gets the job done very well. The battery life is also very good. Highly recommended for casual browsing and games. Great tablet, only thing needed is a better camera. However, for the price, it can\\'t be beat. Lightweight, performant, and packed with features. This device is great for reading, music, or movies on the go as well as web browsing and email. Easy to use, like lighted screen for reading in dark Better than I expected for the price. Works good and I would fully recommend I am very satisfied with this product. It performs extremely well in all areas of its operation. We bought one of these for my daughter to help with her learning. There are so many possibilities with this. It\\'s way cheaper than an Ipad and does basically the same thing. I absolutely love my Fire tablet. Great size, lots of space and a great reader. I can\\'t recommend this product enough. I like this tablet, its thin, light and easy to use. It\\'s great for kids and adults as well. Have been pleased with my purchase of the Fire HD8 as it\\'s video quality is great when viewing ESPN3/Netflix/YouTube Tutorials.The ability to easily load and read my saved textbooks within the Amazon Kindle App is fantastic for a fraction of the price for an IPAD. : ) The first Fire HD8 we purchased died within 1 week of purchase. We had to go back and exchange it for a new one. Not a good sign so far. I I bought this for a friend since she liked mine so much.It is a great way to check emails and read Kindle e-Books.I keep an SD card in mine and store my books on it. You can just drop this in your purse to read on the go. Husband is a first time user, he is doing really well with it.. He has low vision problems and this made reading his favorite books a lot easier to read. It\\'s actually a very good product for a decent price. Not lightning fast but it is okay for everyday use. Love customer service very knowledgeable and helpful Very good tablet for the price economical and the ability to carry in backpack I bought this Kindle for my husband\\'s birthday. I have had a Kindle since 2013 and I used it mostly to read and check emails while travelling. My husband is not particularly a book reader, but he spends way too many hours alone, in his office, reading his face book messages. Now, with the new Kindle he actually multi-tasks, in the living room, on facebook, email, and internet, at least in proximity to me, so he might even join me in a conversation! I think his Kindle has much imporoved our 35 year marriage! It is easy to use. It was cheap. Have not found anything about it that I do not like. i really love this product because it lets me read books and surf the net Love this tablet. Bought it to be my touch screen remote for my harmony hub, but use it for so much more now. make sure you buy a micro sd card with at least 64 gb of memory. or you will have to constantly delete old items. This is a good product but the one I bought stops working after three or four typed sentences and the Geek Squad guy told me when I brought it back that I had to go into settings and clear the data when it does that. WRONG ANSWER. That should never have to be done. He had no idea what he was doing and North Haven Best Buy didn\\'t offer to fix or replace my Kindle. This is the third product I have had to go back and either return or exchange because it wasn\\'t working properly or at all. One manager tried to excuse the store by asking me if I understand Best Buy doesn\\'t actually manufacture these products. If that is the best they can do to explain why they, as the Point of Sale, keep selling defective products, the North Haven store has a big problem. like the speed the 8 inch screen is great. Works well. Up and coming new technology helps everyone to enjoy life more greatly This is the perfect tablet for my purposes. Easy to use and the perfect size. Not too large and not too small. This device is s really good piece of electronic. It is a good reader and also is very good for my 2 year old granddaughter to use. For my son as a present for college books. 5 textbooks were 1/4 the price on kindle than if we bought them on Amazon, this is my third kindle. Other two still working great, I bought this to replace a 7\"fire hd tablet that broke. Amazon changed the operating system so it took me a while to figure it out. I set this up for my son with special needs. I tried to make it as simple as possible for him. It is a little bigger. The sound isn\\'t as good as the previous fire tablet. It also seems very slippery. I got a rubber honeycomb type cover for it. That seems to help us to grip it better. Over all, it\\'s a good tablet for a child. Just use parental controls, and get a good cover for it. Reciever of this really likes and and says its a step up from the fire hd7, so I guess that is what counts. My bf got me this as a birthday present from my son. It\\'s just like my 7\" although larger. I cannot tell the different between the regular and the HD and I game on it. I\\'m not sure if it cost more, but wouldn\\'t waste the money if it did. Noticeable improvement over the fire 7 inch. If you\\'re a first-time tablet owner then the fire 7 inch is a great device. But if you\\'ve owned a tablet with higher specs, there is a noticeable improvement with the fire 8 inch . The Fire 8\" has a better display and faster processing. Very satisfied for $39.95 sales price. Way faster than I expected. I purchased this for a small child to use. She is quite happy with it, however it was a little too slow for my taste. My new Kindle is an upgrade from my 7 year old Kindle Fire. As to be expected the video quality is better along with faster performance and more features. I still use my old Kindle as it is still ticking but the \"shiny new toy\" is fun. This is the second Fire tablet that I have purchased. The first I returned in after I was not able to load YouTube onto the tablet. Amazon\\'s take on Android was just to unfriendly to make it work. With this new tablet, Amazon has heard my concern and now I\\'m enjoying this tablet. It\\'s well built for a sub-$100 device, but won\\'t stand up to a lot of abuse. Reliable, price efficient device. Easy to use for all ages. I can play games, surf the internet or watch movies. I can check my e-mail or just about do anything I can do on a regular computer.I strongly recommend it. This is a terrific tablet at a great price. The quality is excellent, the price is right, it has tons of storage capacity. And oh, did I mention that it\\'s cheap? (Cheap for a tablet, that is.) Had a great experience with my Best Buy rep! Great Job! Small, portable and very easy to use. I have not had any issues as of yet. I purchased this product on a whim with a very limited purpose which was to study for an exam while in the middle seat on a long flight. I expected to hand it to my 10-year old after my exam. The surprise was that really enjoy the device and in particular I like the Amazon account integration: On my next flight I was delighted to find that the unit actually downloads my videos for offline viewing! The best part is that I upgraded the memory with a 64GB SD card so now my available content is awesome! Truth is that my first unit inexplicably failed but Best Buy replaced my unit right away and I expect great things with this new device! My son also uses it on long trips!!! I bought the HD Fire 7 for my wife,I liked hers decided to buy the Fire HD 8 for myself I love it.Nice graphics easy to use. Able to download music and movies free!!!!!!!!!!!! I have used the Kindle mostly for reading. I have downloaded books from Amazon, some free some purchased, that I have heard about for years and now will read. I have also read Manga from the Internet. My use of the internet has also included looking up gardening hints, animal care, and dog breed characteristics. Need to have some computer savvy. Wound be much more helpful if it came with a simple basic instructions. This was a gift for my son and he loves it. It not only helps him with his homework but he could also play games on it! You cannot top the value at this price point with any other tablet. The only reason I give it 4 stars instead of 5 is the limited app selection through the amazon app store. If this came with the google play store, I would give it a 5 in a heartbeat. Overall it is a great tablet at this price point. I would highly recommend it. Great for my mom who isn\\'t tech savvy. Luv it! :-) Very smooth tablet no lag at all also good battery. Love the kindle will continue to buy them for my family awesomeness, love how i xan watch my xfinity movies This tablet is not only a great price but exactly what I needed for quick Internet access and to download books ! I purchased the Amazon Fire HD 8 to replace my 2nd generation Kindle Fire. It works great and the colors are sharp. The 8 is bigger and lighter weight than my old 7 and the battery life is longer. It also has more storage and a camera. Love it! I lost my tablet in Germany and wanted a replacement fast. Best Buy, had both the 7 and 8 inch Kindle fires in stock, after reading the reviews, I decided to go with the 8 inch. Boy was I glad that I did, the larger viewing area, is great for watching movies and Netflix on the airplane. The 8 inch has stereo sound , unlike the 7 inch which has only mono. Overall I am really happy with this tablet Pros - HD quality for low price. Works really well with my Amazon account to access multiple Amazon features with extreme ease. Couldn\\'t be happier. I have iPads too which are extremely versatile but they came with a big price but not this tablet. Love it! We bought this one and a black one for our kids. It\\'s very durable and good price for the quality. For myself personally, I still prefer my iPad, but if on a budget, you won\\'t regret the investment. It\\'s so simple I sometimes struggle using it. The free time experience is awesome for little ones and I can set parameters, which is a huge bonus. For a first-time tablet user, this is a solid product. A very good product by amazon. Considering the price, even better. Good for watching movies, reading books and playing games but don\\'t expect to do much more. Everything else can be a challenge and it can get laggy and once in a while it\\'ll just shut down a program or completely reboot. Excellent product. I would definitely purchase again. After using this tablet for a while, I have found that I even prefer this size over my iPad Air. Easy to carry around and long battery life make this my preferred device. The screen is just the perfect size for my older eyes, the screen on the 7\" fire is just too small and cramped, and it seemed a lot less responsive. I highly recommend this sweet tablet. This was a BIRTHDAY GIFT for my LITTLE one and she LOVED it! I purchased two of these as Christmas presents for my children. I had been researching child friendly tablets with robust controls to keep them away from undesirable content. I found the 7\" Fire Kids Edition, but after looking over the specs and reviews, I found myself unsure of it. I was mostly interested in the FreeTime application, so I did some research on that and found that it was available on other Fire models also. I came across the new Fire HD8, which had more power, a better screen, and far better battery life at a very affordable price point. I gave them a shot and I\\'m glad I did.I have the Fire HD8\\'s locked into FreeTime mode, so the only activities that can be done are ones that I approve of, but if I want to, I can pick up either of them and unlock them to access Netflix/Amazon Prime or anything else I desire. I currently have reading goals set up that they must achieve before they are able to access videos or games, and those are limited to X amount of time per day. FreeTime also has a bedtime feature which disables/enables the use of the tablets during designated times, which is amazing.The hardware itself is exceptional. The screen resolution is excellent, it\\'s very responsive, and the battery life is spectacular! They advertise up to 12 hours of battery life, and depending on screen brightness, ours last almost that long regularly. The only con I can think of is that the cameras are sub-par, but that\\'s not what I purchased the tablets for, so it\\'s a non-issue for myself.Some of the reviews I read cited that the internal storage was easily filled with FreeTime content, so I installed 128GB SD cards in them. I also purchased some rugged children\\'s cases for them off of Amazon.This is probably one of the best purchases I have made in a long time. The sound of silent children reading all day is priceless!!! I bought this tablet for my sister to replace her kindle. We love it except for the fact it would not connect to ATT internet. I suspect this was an ATT problem. The internet could not be authenticated. Since we have had problems with ATT for seven years, I am sure it was a problem with them! Once my sis read the instructions, she was good to go! Great tablet for a kid enjoys very much would buy again Overall, very impressed especially when compared to my iPad mini 4. This tablet does it all and makes for an excellent e-reader, while also boasting specifications that rival any iPad. works great for us for video calling, for kids watching videos My wife loved her gift. I made the right purchase. I own two Amazon fire tablets with this one being the same as owned.. My sister in law wanted a tablet and since I owned one just like this one I figured it to be a good buy.. She just loves it, she is able to do her scheduling, read books and watch her news programs.. It\\'s a great Alertanative to an iPad... great price and just as powerful for a lot less cost.. These Kindle Fire tablets simply can\\'t be beat in terms of value and bang for your buck if you have an Amazon Prime account it would be a crime not to have a Fire tablet.Good strong build quality, very nice bright screen with a strong picture and good resolution. They are pretty responsive, have good battery life and can handle the abuse of letting your kids use it as well. We bought this tablet for our son in college and he loves it. This is my first tablet and it\\'s going well so far. I purchased this for reading and streaming. There have been a few hiccups with regards to a streaming video buffering for a long time and sometimes I have trouble with response on commands, but overall, I\\'m happy. It\\'s been a nice device to have for reading online material offline. Replaced my hd fire 7 because broke screed. Very pleased with the large screen. My only dislike is that being a Kindle, my Kindle books cannot be sorted into categories. It\\'s harder to find new books I\\'ve downloaded some time ago when I have to search through all of them. Purchased as a gift. The receiver loves it and said that it works nicely. Purchased this for my 80 year old mother in law to replace her old cracked screen one. Everything was perfect easy to use and set up. She has zero problems using this for online and reading books. Love it I sent one down to my family in Mexico they loved it Bought this as a gift for my mother. She absolutely loves it. Easy to set up and use. and the price was right. I am loving this tablet. My previous tablet was a 1st year Fire. This tablet is great for reading, games,facebook and emails. This is my third Kindle and I have loved them all. I still have my first Kindle and use it. I just wore my Kindle Fire out with 5 + years use. I am very happy with everything my new one can do. No disappointments at all. I got this for my husband for his birthday. He likes the light weight and the speakers and how powerful it is. Got it for my Dad. Easy to use and he loves it. Good stepping stone for future producs One of the best purchases or investments you could make for technology. I bought it for kindle books and was amazed by its overall features. Its Kindle with features of a TAB. I bought this primarily for reading, but, being a tablet it is able to do so much more! I can listen to music, download movies and check email. I love it! Way better than my Nook! Great tablet for price! Fast, works great, great sound volume, great pixelation and screen size I\\'m new to tablets but this one is pretty easy to understand and use.There\\'s a decent amounts of apps at start up, which can be good and bad. i would buy this item again. however charging port is so far. A few not so great things, modt of them managed to resolve them though. This is a nice little tablet and Great for the kids Not a huge fan of products that aren\\'t Apple but this one is good. Haven\\'t had any problems with them at all. I bought this for my sister as a gift so she need not use her laptop for basic internet surfing and to watch movies while travelling. The device speed is decent although you cannot compare the performance to a laptop. If you want to avoid carrying a bulky laptop during travel and want a budget make do device for laptop then choose amazon fire tablet. I got this tablet for my mother and cousins. It\\'s been very speedy to my surprise, not as fast as a high end tablet but no lag and a very nice 720p display with good build quality. Would definitely recommend if your looking for an affordable tablet YOU PAY FOR THE BEST AND YOU GET THE BEST. THANK YOU BEST BUY FOR PROVIDING THIS PRODUCT I have an older Kindle and enjoyed it very much. However, there is so much more improvement in this tablet with faster processing speed, upgradable storage and longer battery life. I\\'m really happy! This was the perfect tablet for what my husband wanted. 8\" size was not too big or too small. You can carry it without it being clumsy to drop. I love my kindle.It is user friendly and there\\'s so much more than I thought. Great little tablet after you add google play store. Takes some research to do. Awesome tablet and great value for money. My son is enjoying it a lot. I bought this as a cheap alternative to an old, slow, iPad 2, until I could spring for the iPad Pro. Got it as a Black Friday deal, so it was more than worth it. Was able to add some missing apps that make it even better than I thought it could be, and having Amazon Prime makes it an inexpensive and handy media device. I carry it in my bag at all times without having to worry about it\\'s value. Can\\'t beat it for the price. I love to read! Books,books, books and more books. Longtime Apple user, but for this price vs an iPad you can\\'t beat this product! Easy to use. Great picture clarity. Wish they had a cellular version. I got this because it was a cheap tablet. It does great for watching videos from the tablet and sound is good also. I don\\'t like the amazon ecosystem or app store. I wish they would sell android tablets with their apps on them like they are doing with their phones. This is a good tablet to own. I like the features. My son needed a tablet to take notes on at college classes. He wanted something small and lightweight instead of taking his laptop. He\\'s found it to work perfectly for what he needs! the first worked fine for three weeks then stopped. took back and got a replacement. this one lasted almost a month. again took it back and was told I had to deal with Amazon.Found out thru Amazon webpage that units simply froze up and how to reset it. Was upset that store associate knew nothing about the product. Had to research everything myself. purchased for my sister for reading books, internet and games - perfect for beginners and novices. Easy to use. Would be a five if available with 4g Love the added space. Easy to move around in. I am excited to use all the new features. Gave as Christmas gift,and wife loved it. She has not put it down since she has gotten it. I love this new Amazon Fire HD. I have a 6 year old and I\\'ve set it up so that he has his own password and he loves to read all the free books available. The different shades of back lights are cool. If you purchase the new Amazon Fire HD, it will enhance your reading experience. I decided to buy this instead of a traditional kindle and I do not regret my decision at all!The only con (for those evaluating this as a tablet) is that Amazon has their own App Store. Many apps from GooglePlay/AppStore are simply not available. We had an old Fire and upgraded to the Fire HD. Love everything about it so far. The fire tablet is a great tool for reading, surfing the web, playing games and even watching some Netflix, on a bigger screen, without killing a cell phone charge. Great value! This tablet is great for everything. It\\'s not as powerful as an iPad but the price can\\'t be beat. I like that it is a good reader and that you can also put some apps on it -- I use it to check email, one note, etc. but primarily as a reader. Got this tablet cause I wanted to start reading more graphic novels and manga and was very impressed with it it runs smooth and even use Hulu and netflix on it. My only flaw with it is that there are ads on your lock screen though you can take them off for $15 other than that it\\'s a grade little tablet! My wife wanted this and I got it for her. She has been totally happy with it. She loves it for its size for reading online books. I am very pleased with my purchase the tablet is a great project is there a product is very versatile Great tablet. Easy to use. Will recommend it to others. If you\\'re looking for a small but effective tablet that\\'s reasonably priced, this tablet is the one for you. It\\'s easy to understand the directions, therefore making it a snap to learn how to work the tablet. It comes in different colors and is easy to read and use. Give it a try. Thanks, Best Buy!!! Very competitive Price - Unit works well we like color and size The HD8 and HD7 are amazing for the price. They aren\\'t top powered tablets, but they\\'re functional tablets. Right now, in Feb 2017, either one is a good replacement for the Nexus 7. Bought this for my niece and she loves it. Very easy to use from what she tells me! I really liked the build quality but the very lackluster performance and minuscule battery life didn\\'t make it a keeper for me. Such a a great tablet that does everything, love it! I am an avid Amazon user for shopping and tablets, I bought a different model for my younger brother and now purchased this one for my grandparents and they love it! I purchased this for my parents who were always viewing facebook or other videos on their cell phones, this Amazon tablet is perfect for them! It\\'s user friendly and if you have an Amazon Prime account has great access to movies and music. I\\'ve had iPad mini\\'s before so this tablet in my opinion can\\'t compare. However, that being said. I bought this tablet for the purpose to watch Netflix and read books on. In my opinion it handles these two task perfectly. The screen isn\\'t as clear and crisp like other tablets but hey I didn\\'t pay $300 for it either. I like this size and it seems fast. I\\'d have to say I like it a lot. On another note, I\\'m giving this review only 4 stars because i am absolutely annoyed at Best Buy and their shipping. This is about the 3rd time I\\'ve ordered a product and had it shipped to me and Best Buy said it would be here at a certain date and UPS screws It up every time. Don\\'t have any issues anywhere else but always when I order from Best Buy and have it mailed to me. Anyways, the tablet is good for the price and I\\'d recommend it over any other lower end teblets. I bought one for my 9 year old son for his birthday - and now we are buying another one for our ten year old. We have had some tech issues as we are juggling three tablets on one account - but with careful monitoring, it\\'s ok. Wonderful little buy! Tired of my bulky tablet. This one stays charged a lot longer! Nice tablet with the slightly bigger screen, great for tv, movies and reading especially for older eyes. Good size as well, it fits nicely into a purse or tote without being too heavy I like because I can download movies to watch offline with netflix I bought this tablet for my mom on her birthday recently. She loves it and uses it all the time. I always wanted a tablet and finally decided on the amazon fire 8. It is awesome and I love it.I downloaded some games and I am enjoying them. It is great for internet too. Definitely worth the price. You get a lot for the money. It had lots more options too. It was okay, but most of my apps were stripped down versions on the HD-Fire. It was inexpeisve, but you get what you pay for. The O/S is pretyy premitive. The hardware does fell nice. I would say it is the perfect device for an older or younger person. ok for price a little slow and doesn\\'t have as many apps as google play. I have owned several kindles. I don\\'t know what I do to them, but they tend to die rather quickly. Thank goodness for Best Buy\\'s extra protection. The last two that quit on me were replaced quickly and effortlessly. Excellent customer service as well! Love using this Kindle to look up real estate sales, play mind games, and take pictures. Love the bigger screen and the great resolution. Sound is also far superior to my older model Lindle. Wife loves it. She said it opens much faster and likes auto updates for apps. Super easy to set up and use :)Got one for daughter and got one for self!!!!!! the tablet is great, but all the advertising is annoying This Tablet does absolutely everything I want! I can watch TV Shows or Movies, check my Mail, Facebook, Google.......pay all my bills. It processes fast and has a beautiful screen. As I said: Everything I want in a Tablet for less than $100! And she has been happy about it ever since. Not being that tech saavy, this specific device has a user-friendly tutorial to help get started. Got this to replace the Samsung tab A 7\". That Samsung tab lagged a lot but I haven\\'t seemed to have as much problems on the fire tab, the only downside is that the battery dies fast. I have had a Samsung Tablet for 3 years, and I have to say that I love this Amazon Kindle 10x better. The picture quality is amazing, it is light weight, it is easy to navigate. Great tablet, great screen, great price! Very user friendly, especially for a not so Tech savvy person. This is as good as my my Ipod! I would recommend it Needed a new tablet for reading books, movies and surfing the Web. This meets all my needs! Great upgrade from Kindle Fire. Reasonably priced for product. I would recommend this to my friends that you can shop on amazon has many preloaded games. Many Apps Great Product and great Price! Love it i would recommend to anyone who is looking for tablet on a good price Simple and easy to use!! The wife takes it everywhere! Easy to use! Just plug in and search for your favorite movies and TV shows. I love my new Fire HD! I had one of the first generation Kindle Fire, and loved it, love this one even more!!! I didn\\'t do any in depth research on this particular tablet. The price and speed were good for what I wanted it for. My only con is not being able to clear the home screen of apps or relocate them so I can see my personal home screen picture. I gave it as a gift to a friend who is a senior citizen who had an Amazon Paperwhite. I thought this would be a lovely upgrade for her and it has been. She loves it!! Great device very functional love it will recommend Bought this for my Father-In-Law for Christmas and he loves it. Easy to use and has already bought 5 books for it! Can\\'t say enough good about it. My 10 year old loves it. Enjoy the Kindle, fun games, can access the Internet, read books, etc. The tablet works just great and the price can\\'t be beat! We did get this when it was in sale for about 50$ and for that this is an incredible value tablet perfect for anyone who wants a screen without paying premium prices. Build quality is fine and screen isn\\'t the best but definitely usable. It\\'s not a regular tablet but I just use it to use Facebook The screen is clear and tablet is faster than i expected. Great colors also! Not the most powerful tablet but is flawless when utilizing the Amazon programs Bought this for my elderly mother who was wanting the ability to read and/or listen to books. After a slow start getting her going (she is not tech savvy) she is really enjoying the versatility of this tablet. Although it does not have cellular data ability, which she had no use for, it gives her the flexibility to connect to wireless networks when she makes her weekly casino visits. For the price it can\\'t be beat. That being said I had to return mine after a week. I just couldn\\'t get over the low resolution screen. It works well for movies and the Web, but I needed it to also show off my photos to others. This was a gift to a friend. So far she loves it.. Books and magazines are easy to access and read!!! Bought this for my 8 year old in place of a Nabi that didn\\'t work out of the package. Great basic tablet for this. As I reviewed different tablets, this tablet kept coming back as my best option for the items I was looking for. It IS a great tablet, but there are a few things I don\\'t really like about it. I didn\\'t realize that Amazon has it\\'s OWN browser SILK. Everything even your banking info goes through Amazon. Not sure I like that. Also, items don\\'t automatically close out when you leave a page and I have to frequently hit the button on the bottom and close out multiple items. It might just be that I am not THAT computer savoy, though I do know how to navigate my way around. Sometimes the touch feature just seems to freeze and won\\'t recognize that I am attempting \\'touch\\'. Lastly, the on/off button is right where you hold the tablet on the side, so I am often \\'accidently\\' shutting it down. Most annoying! Overall, I am happy with my purchase and for the price I like it. Just wanted to point out the other items. serves all my needs in a economy tablet and I would reccomend it to all. Good product with best price available in the market place Tablet is a great tool to use the world wide web and check email. works great, wife loves it. Always happy with the kindle Has a few quirks that are disconcerting bur overall a great product. Only a few quirks when it comes to this Kindle. Better quality sound and display. Great tablet. Picture is super sharp and so easy to read. I picked this tablet up for a 5 year old grandchild as a way to learn how to use a tablet works fine . We previously bought a 7 inch, 8 GB Kindle for my son which he used a lot. Eventually though he dropped it and it no longer worked. This past Christmas we purchased the Amazon Fire HD8, 16 GB.This model was an improvement over the previous one. With twice the internal storage, my son wasn\\'t always coming to me to delete games because he ran out of storage. Another great feature is the external SD card slot. We bought a 32 GB card and he\\'s not had to delete anything.The quad-core processor is a big improvement over the previous gen model. Apps and games load quickly with not lag in running them. There also seemed to be an improvement in the battery life so it doesn\\'t have to be charging all the time or plugged in the the power cord.This is a great purchase for any child! Excellent product.Relable.Maximum speed.Fast downloading Love this tablet. It\\'s big enough so I can see. It works with my prime so I can watch movies or stream music. I purchased a Kindle a few years ago and Have loved the flexibility it give me. I can browse the internet without moving to my desk to get on my personal computer. I love the fact that I can continue to read my books while I travel. Doctor Office Visits seem to just roll by more calmly now because I can ignore the office chatter and the TV selections I rather not watch. I encouraged others to make the purchase and several have done just that. This is my second purchase. Love It! I purchased this for my mother and she has been going on about how wonderful the Amazon fire is. It\\'s the perfect size easy to use and she can even do her banking on it which she loves. I would definitely recommend the Amazon fire thank you This is my second kindle. I love using them for reading, web searching, etc. I download some of my favorite knitting patterns, so when on the road I have something to work with.I love love love this kindle. Bigger screen, slimmer and lighter. Great tablet just what my wife wanted, loves the wifi, much better than her old one. Was a gift and they love the tablet! Its a great price and works awesome! The amazon fire tablet 2016 is quite good. It provides sufficient content & ability to do all of the basics one requires in a tablet. The 8 inch screen is bright and provides various settings. The tablet\\'s light weight makes it very portable. Need to buy a tablet for my Mother as a Christmas gift. Functionality is great and she uses it for all her online needs The Fire HD 8 is the perfect size EReader. Big enough to see the text but small enough to hold comfortably. I bought this Amazon Fire HD8 as a Christmas present for my wife. It is the second tablet I have given to her over the past 5 years. She LOVES it! It goes wherever she goes. The Fire is more than portable and so easy to use. As the saying goes: \"A Happy Wife Means A Happy Life\". I wouldn\\'t hesitate to recommend the Fire to anyone! Gave this to my daughter for Christmas. She loves it. Uses it every day. Good buy! I use it mainly for reading e-books and browsing. However, I wished there were more apps available. Also, before unlocking the tablet, ads are shown in the lockscreen. If the tab is locked, it stops streaming the ads. You can pay $15 to disable the ads permanently. I only recommend this for basic use. If you want to use it for games or other apps, I would recommend a stronger tablet like the ipad or samsung galaxy. This is my second Kindle Fire, and the only reason is because I upgraded. They\\'re a great little tablet. Very versatile and fast loading times. Definitely recommend. Good quality android tablet. also makes a very nice gift. I purchased this for my 12 year old and it was at a great price point. I like the parental controls feature with the multiple profiles. This allows me to control what she has access to which is a plus for me. Thanks perfect for my little kids they love this tablet good quality and fast enough for them Can\\'t say enough about the Kindle Fire. It literally is fiiiiiiyah... fast, easy to use, and an all-around perfect tablet. Recommend keeping an eye out for special pricing at holidays to save some cheddar, but otherwise I\\'d say pick this little black rectangle of portable interwebz awesomeness up the first chance you get. The best product for the money. East to use, great color, great features. easy to set up and battery life is great. This was a gift for a family member they really enjoy all the options of getting books I bought this one for 40$ during the black Friday sale, as a gift to my cousin. He was flattered by the performance, even I didn\\'t expect it to be this good! It works flawlessly with the usual games and apps, what you are going to miss the most is YouTube, amazon\\'s app store does not have youtube. Other than that it meets all my requirements for daily use. Best B It is helping them to learn to read and follow directions .Best Buy had the products and provided great customer service. Grandsons are enjoying product use. This tablet exceeds its reviews. its easy to use and the screen is great. My husband and I purchased the new Amazon Kindle Fire HD 8 tablets for our 16 yr old son and 12 yr old daughter for Christmas. I have an older version 7 in myself so I already knew we were buying a durable tablet. The new ones are awesome and they had them in colors so very easy to distinguish who\\'s is whom We purchased during Black Friday and got them for $30 off, which was an amazing discount and made me love it even more. We had shopped around many places prior to and. They are light weight and the screen is plenty big enough for them to watch movies, play games, do homework and video calls friends and family out of town. They seem to have plenty of space and nice to know that we can add memory if we need to.The tablets hold up to the everyday life of the kids accidental drops kicks and their 3 yr old sister lol. Would definitely recommend this product to anyone who is in the market for a new tablet for themselves or children. Will buy again in the future if these ever quick working. Bought it for my little grandson he likes games, he can play with it where ever there is wifi. the tablet was on sale for a good price, and they had enough in stock for the CHRISTMAS season> grand children were thrilled. Good tablet and a great price. I use it for reading, Netflix and email. good for beginners play games ,take picture and recording videos old the time Won the kindle fire 6 last xmas2015 at work raffle. Gladly got this kindle fire 8 for a bigger screen and better battery life. Love it. One of the best inexpensive tablets on the market. Great for the casual user Loving this tablet, 5 stars in my opinion, definitely worth it. Easy and fun to use. Also, a perfect size even for a man\\'s hand. Bought as a gift and they love it! Great for the price. I went in to buy my 88 year old Dad an Amazon Fire book reader....The customer service from the begining was great!. An Associate immediately approached me, showed me several models, with explaining them all. After picking one. I was then told of the \"free shipping\" of which i did utilize. My dad received within a couple of days , on his birthday, and was able to go to his local Best Buy, and have an Assocate show/explain how to use. He was sooo excited and pleased with the item and service....and so am I. Also, the price was right tooo! This is a great reading product. Love the light adjustment in low light areas. I can adjust the font sizes for my reading comfort and I can do other things like download apps or watch movies! i really loved my 7in. but i love 8.5 in. a whole lot.!!!!!!!!!!!!!thanks guys!!! I bought this 8\" Amazon Fire HD for my Wife as a Christmas Present. Her old 7\" Amazon Fire that she had for about 3-4 Years. She is very happy with the 8\" Amazon Fire HD. Can\\'t beat the price for a Tablet. My son loves it, he can watch videos, read books and play games. Excellent and inexpensive. ITunes store and Google Play store have more apps to choose from, but this is still a very useful tablet. Expandable SD micro memory a definite +. Have not had time to REALLY use it, but hope to download books and games. This is a great, easy to use tablet for the price. It\\'s a 16 GB mini-computer and camera perfect for trips. enjoying reading via the device; lots of options is also a plus; a little heavy to hold when reclining Needed a present for mom, at first she didn\\'t use it much cause she had to set it up but now it\\'s great and she loves it. Bought this for my 83-year old Mother. She loves it! We bought it two days before it went on sale for Christmas and Best Buy was excellent with price matching asesome!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! performs as designed got it on sale for 79 dollars Is great for my son 8 years old, they help with homework We own an ipad,samsug tablets and we have both love are fire8\\'s wave better. This tablet was affordable and it\\'s pretty decent. Bought this for my dad, he is 87. Very easy to use and setup. He loves it and uses it 3/4 hours a day At first was going to get a iPad but I decided to get this instead way cheaper then a iPad and just as good, love it.. Couldn\\'t recommend this more for kids. Price and features are awesome along with parental controls. The functionality is great although I wish it came in more colors. I didn\\'t actually use as I bought for a gift. My grandson already had one so we returned for a pair if 3-d goggles. use as a reader and music, games watches movies i good all round tablet Just thought we were purchasing a capability to download and read books, magazines, etc. But, for such a low price was surprised at the total capabilities available. I GOT THE FIRE HD SO MY KIDS COULD READ BOOKS , PLAY GAMES AND WATCH THEIR SHOWS . WITHOUT SPENDING AN ARM AND A LEG FOR THE TABLET. I THINK THIS IS A GOOD TABLE FOR KIDS / YOUNG TEENS WHO WANT TO HAVE A TABLET BUT NOT BREAK THE BANK. We bought one for my wife and my mother-in-law and they both love it. Very easy to use. My kids love it. Battery life is longer than others. This was a gift for my mother who is 99 years. She used to love puzzles, but with arthritis and failing eyesight she couldn\\'t do them. The puzzle app is good because she can see it and use finger to slide pieces. She can keep up with family on Facebook Very decent tablet. I was skeptical at first but it\\'s performance surprised me. Battery lasts a decent amount of time and connects beautifully into the Amazon ecosystem I already am in. Would recommend to anyone who likes to watch videos/browse the web on the go or for children. I purchased this for traveling. I can access my e-mail, books and games without lugging my laptop. I\\'m sure I will learn more as needed. Best buy was very helpful & the tablet is good for reading books & basic serfing This is a perfect size and weight. Everything is very clear, sharp and large enough to be comfortably readable. Word has it that relationships are interrupted by electronic devices. Well my girl takes her reader everywhere we go. She used to tell me I talk to much. Now I can hardly get a word in edgewise! This is smaller and lighter than my previous fire and works even better It\\'s not a $400.00 tablet so what can you expect, except that it does what it\\'s suppose to. It\\'s faster than I thought it would be so thats killer. So far I love this tablet especially for reading. The battery life has also been good Everything I expected with none of the drawbacks I have found in other tablets Works well. Probably best android tablet you can get for the money. Great tablet. No problems at all. Excellent Price. the only downside of it is that you can\\'t have google playstore on this tablet but you can still install it manually since they both based on android os I bought it for my mom after moving her into an assisted living place. . I was able to use it a little to show mom I was very happy with it. Seems fast and easy to use.i like it better than my phone . :) Didn\\'t get a chance to see how camera was yet. I love everything about my new kindle except for the fact that the charging cord is already loose. Great for those who love to read this tablet is always ready for on the go trips Bought the fire for my mother who is 72 to learn how to use a computer the price was right and she can use it to search the web I only have an older ipad to compare this to, but there is literally no comparison. The Fire 8\" tablet is lightweight, connects ultra fast to wifi, has an easy-to-follow automatic set up, and comes with tons of features that I\\'m only beginning to explore. I wasn\\'t expecting this at all! I\\'m a total convert especially because the price is so reasonable, too. This is a great Tablet. Love the features and resolution Super fast. Lots of storage. Great tablet for anyone. bought as a gift for Christmas. they love it!!!!!! This is an upgrade tablet from my first Kindle Fire that I purchased 5 years ago. Love the larger screen the quick processing and downloads, the great HD visuals, and most importantly all of my previous pictures and music files were easily transferred/accessed by this new device. Love that this Fire has a front and rear camer too, my old Fire only had a front facing camera. Granted this is not an iPad, but I don\\'t want or need all an iPad does. And I definitely don\\'t want to spend hundreds of dollars on a device just because it is cool. My Fire tablet does everything I need or want and it costed under $99.00. I am one satisfied and pleased customer. very easy to use I live my fire the best purchase I have made in months The only reason why I have not given a 5 star review is because sometimes, the unit freezes out of nowhere after I will be reading news articles or after watching Prime/Netflix Gift for Mom. This is her first tablet. She is having no issues so far. Great value for the price. Easy to navigate and has good picture quality. I bought it to watch Netflix, browse internet, read books on Kindle, and watch YouTube. Very nice tablet for low price. The shell feels a little on the cheap side but added a cover (Fintie) & feels much more sturdy. Great for reading or watching netflix or amazon video. Purchased this to get a lighter tablet. Also to update our my old tablet which had a replaceable battery. This is all around lighter ,thinner and easier to handle. HD is a good upgrade and can\\'t beat the price for comparable tablets with same features. my wife reads on it daily and loves it. I am probably going to search for another one.We have the 8\" and I would like to try a 7\" if it were available.I like to try different size devices to see how I adjust same way with todays phones. I\\'d recommend this highlyGreat buy for the priceGood graphics and easy to use. Good product bought it as a Christmas gift. I will be purchasing another one soon. Wanted one that played bejeweled blitz. This one does not. A gift to my 3 year old grandson. Great graphics and sound. The size of the Fire tablet gives you the feel of having a book in your hands while reading a book. Because of the size and lightweight it\\'s easy to transport and fits easily in my purse. I\\'m enjoying my Fire tablet which was a gift. The tablet is Excellent! Very fast and well worth the money! The display is great! I got this for my kid as a gift so he could read books easier and it has helped a ton! I got an 8\" windows tablet for my father in law and we quickly realized that windows is not a good choice for someone that is not already comfortable with all the windows features that are not tablet friendly. This tablet on the other hand, had a very easy learning curve and my father in law became comfortable with all the features in a couple of hours. I would definitely recommend it as a gift. The 8 inch Amazon Fire 6th edition is by the far the best tablet in the Amazon market. The 7-inch is a nice size, but the 8-inch has better screen resolution and longer battery life. If you are an Amazon Prime member, this is a must have tablet. Also, the Amazon magnetic case does a great job in protection and sleek-ness. I bought four of these for my kids and they love them Great tablet for my childthis tablet was just everything that I need it for my child Very easy to use and small enough to travel with. I slide it right into my bag. I would recommend this ereader above all others for its high quality and diversity. Not only as an ereader but as a web browser. I got my father a Amazon Fire he\\'s never used a tablet let alone a computer. So it was a challenge. He did pretty good but ha\\'s a hard time seeing the screen. I love my new Kindle Fire even more than my old one which I lost. Very good buy. I am enjoying my new tablet. Great buy! Learning all the aps that are on the Kindle, the games and all the free books. Perfect for a kid and it was cheap! My son has broke a lot of tablets, this one seems durable. I travel a lot and this is perfect for watching movies or reading on the flights The Kindle is great! It\\'s easy to set up and I\\'ve found all the books that I wanted. I got this on an impulse buy, mostly for my 16+ hour flight, but also just in general. Was in line buying something when I saw this at an unbelievable price! So I bought it and have no regrets! For the price ($69.99) it\\'s a great tablet, though you can only get apps through the amazon app store not the Android app store, which limits you. But that\\'s alright, as I mostly got it for watching videos and movies and that sort of stuff. And occasionally some games! Great tab and the price cannot be beat, Only gripe is the fire os. Oh well This tablet is great for the price. It has good connection to wi if. The kindle store is a breeze. The picture quality is good. And seems to be the perfect size. A nice alternative compared to The more expensive tablet. And much better quality then the less expensive tablets I would recommend I bought two Kindle Fires for my 4 year old twin grandsons this past Christmas. We downloaded lots of educational programs for them and they absolutely love it! No need to buy them an IPAD which was far more costly! I have had every version of the Kindle since the week it was introduced and jumped at the chance for a Kindle Fire. I replaced the first one I had in 2014 and it was everything I wanted except this past summer it started overheating and got nonresponsive in the midday heat. So...I got this one. First of all I miss Swype. WHY get rid of it? Secondly I cannot put two of my favorite apps (which work on my old one) to work on this but lastly and most importantly: every once in awhile the screen freezes with a bunch of code \"shimmering\" in the background and only turning it off and/or leaving it for awhile brings it back to life AND it turns itself off. It seems to happen when I close a program and move to a new one. Aggravating and not what I expect from a product with which I have been happy in the past. My granddaughter love this fire for al her games. We also downloaded a music app for her and she is so happy with this. So many things she will learn how to do on this tablet. Bought a Kindle Fire for my wife several years ago, our son is now 9 and he had kind of taken over the tablet from my wife. So we decided he was responsible enough and bought this for him for Christmas. I cannot believe the improvement over the previous Kindle Fire we own. The screen is more clear and bright and even seems more detailed, apps load faster, it connects to the internet faster. For the $89.99 they currently sell for I would say it is an excellent value. If you can wait, we paid less at Christmas so a lower price could be seen again. We\\'ve had three of these Kindles. They are well built and you can\\'t get the quality in a tablet from any other manufacturer. Amazon has great support with them. This was a great purchase! Love the fact I can download TV or movies and watch off-line. Easy set up. I bought this for my wife she loves how easy it is to use and small enough to take on trips. I bought the first edition kindle fire years ago. My kids loved it so much that I bought this product to replace the old one. They love this one even more. Larger screen and more memory, you can\\'t go wrong! Gift for my grandpa so he can do internet searches from his chair and play games. He loved it. It\\'s simple to use and inexpensive I love my kindle fire it\\'s is good for watching movies reading and anything you need a tablet for. We get this after my son broke his Samsung tablet and I told was android operating system but wen the time to set it up came, takes me a little lounger to make a new account, password and paretal control for my kid but am happy that finally did it This was a replacement for an Amazon Fire tablet. This was a an up grade for my daughter who broke the screen on her old one. She absolutely loved her old one. She says the new one is even better.!! I bought this kindle fire for my teenage son so he could use it at school and play games on the kindle, he loves it. You will not find another tablet like this with the affordable price. This tablet is small enough to pack but the screen is the perfect size for watching movies on the plane when traveling. love the ease of use with tablet, have not had any issues I highly recommend kindles. I wouldn\\'t own anything else. I love reading and this is the best device yet not only for reading. This has wifi capabilities. I would highly recommend this item. I had Microsoft Surface, unfortunately daughter dropped and cracked screen so needed a new tablet. Since went back to laptop for work didn\\'t need another Surface. Settled on 8\" Kindle HD over Samsung and IPad mini due to value. I only use for social networks, email, games, internet search, and occasional viewing of videos. This is a good basic tablet that can handle this no problem with a good wifi connection. Great value as I paid under $100 during the holidays and it has been as good as my Surface for these basic uses. I recently upgraded to this model of Kindle. Liked it so much I bought this one for my daughter. She loves it. It\\'s much nicer than the older model she and I had. I had a very early generation Kindle that I loved. I was unwilling to update my Kindle because it was so great. The new one I got from my wife made it look like the old one was standing still. It\\'s much faster and I love it. I love this tablet because of its user friendly interface. It reminds me of a starter tablet for kids, without being too much of a dull product. Great product. I got this as a gift for a family member and she loves it. Wry basic, but I guess, it\\'s ok for the price. Bought for a 6 year old. Bought as gift for senior. Setup process could be easier. Nice handheld size. Clear text. Easy to read books on. Bought this for my daughter to use in school, she loves it! Product works great! I also bought the older version for my mom and she lives it as well I would like to say this is my best tablet I have ever buy till now. I will rate it more then iPad Mini. Its best with battery, wifi, touchscreen, sound etc. I had other tablet for my kids earlier, but after having fire hd8, I will not recommend or like to go for any other brand in future. You can\\'t get such good quality product in such less price. I am really very happy on my right decision to choose fire hd8 for my family and kids. This is a good product for your money. It\\'s basic it does the job. Love the access to films. Easy to read and work with. A Little like an Android. I am used to IPhone apps but this works great once you understand it. Broke the screen on our 2nd gen fire so this is it\\'s replacement. Easy setup, Much faster than older one. Just the right size for games, email, social media. This is decent reader and Netflix device. Lots of bugs and gotchas when trying to use - icons going off screen, random locking, random performance hits while doing the same task. Returned. Buying an iPad mini 2. The build quality is just not there. Great and informative service. The guy who helped us was very friendly. Love the Fire, the picture is good and really like the amazon link I have an LG tablet but picked up this one for my Dad and after messing with it for a while it\\'s very nice,. I think I like it more the my LG g pad! This is a great tablet. My family and I love it. Lots of feature and faster than I thought it would be. Better then the older models bigger and better then before I really enjoy my amazon. It is getting easyer to use and I am finding new apps every day. This tablet is awesome...HD resolution, fast processor and affordable! Highly Recommended. Nice tablet. Very speedy. The only thing I don\\'t like is that I can\\'t add GooglePlay apps to it. At only $69.00 I guess that\\'s to be expected. I use my kindle on a daily basis. It is a good size for reading in bed. The kindle was great but too small for my vision impaired mother, it was a gift, My son totally loves it! The size is just right, and it is pretty fast. I don\\'t have any complaints about it. On Christmas Eve I went in looking for an iPad as a gift. They were sold out and I was directed to the Amazon Fire HD8. The picture quality is amazing (hence the HD). I watched a movie on it and the picture was better than my HD tv. I have to say, I would buy this tablet over an iPad any day...AND it cost less than a fourth of the price! Decent tablet for the price. My kids love them!!!! I am extremely pleased. Fast. Efficient. Reliable. Purchased to watch movies. Quality is great. Sound from tablet needs work but earphone is usually used or at least recommended for personal use. My son loves his kindle fire. He uses it every day. The Amazon Fire HD8 tablet is a high quality, inexpensive piece of technology that works great for anyone looking to purchase one that won\\'t break the bank. Once taking time to install google play store, It functioned as good as any other android tablet. The down side is camera which doesn\\'t produce clear pictures. Bought for someone not tech savvy and he\\'s done great Bought this tablet on sale. I can look up all the things I \\'m interested in. This is a great product second one i purchase recomend it. The tablet has a very clear and crisp screen. The device is easy to setup. There is a quite abit of preinstalled apps. The responsiveness is great, connectivity is good, but sound is not great. This tablet is great considering how affordable it is! I mainly use it for reading, streaming shows, and listening to music. I do wish it was a true Android platform instead of the \"Amazon Android\" platform, but overall it\\'s a great little tablet! It\\'s great for my 7 year old. Easy for her to use. Wasn\\'t happy with first one I opened as Christmas gift, it didn\\'t work from right out of the box. Contacted Amazon and they sent a new one the next day. This one has worked from the get go. I\\'m now enjoying my new tablet. Very happy with Amazons service and prompt response to the issue. This is good for kids. Cheap enough that if they destroy it, you won\\'t get upset Great product for my 10 year old son. Very easy for him to find what he wants Love Alexa and all of its features. Love that I can listen to music and read ebooks Paid $60 for it on sale during holidays, couldn\\'t ask for better product for the price Bought this for each of my grandchildren and they loved it. Very user friendly Great value from Best Buy. Bought at Christmas sale. great tablet well worth the price which was a deal on black friday Original Kindle Fire would finally no longer charge so bought this to replace. Not quite the quality of original (not as fast, resolution not as good) but can\\'t complain for the price. Good choice for casual web surfing and reading. Does the trick. This is a good tablet for the price. I bought this for my 3yr old son and it\\'s perfect for him! With a mixture of games (kid friendly) and read-along books makes it a perfect for the kids and of course there\\'s so much more for adults as well.. great buy! Great tablet, especially for the price. I bought this to replace an old Fire 7 tablet, that I had the battery going down. It works nicely and I love the Kindle Freetime and the parental control settings. Great little tablet for cruzing the internet and using Amazon products. I purchased it hoping I could use it as an inexpensive screen for my DJI Phantom 4. It works OK in this fashion, but I believe it is underpowered for the job. I bought this for my niece and she really enjoyed it. She was able to watch Netflix on it and play games. She could surf the internet if she needed to. We went with the bigger GB since it wasn\\'t much more. Gave it as a door prize at office party. They love it. This tablet is simple to set up and it\\'s worth the price. It\\'s perfect for beginners. Great tablet for easy operation. Was a great upgrade for a family member. My 2nd Fire. Great picture quality. Easy to use. Would recommend for all ages. I bought this to take on cruise to read and listen to music... less expensive than my tablet, so if I loose it not as big a loss... it does all I thought it would..easy to set up... to get the most from this tablet you should be an amazon prime member $100 a year, not required,but lots of benefits from it OK its not an iPad, but it is a very good tablet for less than 100 dollars.My only complaint is that it don\\'t have a true GPS chip and relies on your WiFi reported location for apps and therefore some apps cannot be loaded on this device that rely on a true GPS. But it is a great travel tablet and with an SD card you can download your Amazon or other content and watch offline. A great travel tablet! For the price you get alot of valueGreat for watching movies amazon shopping youtube I got a magenta color because I loved the beautiful purple-ish color shown on the picture. Instead I got a really bright pink-ish color which looks nothing like the color shown here. I went to the store hoping to replace it with a different color but was told that since I bought it on sale, I had to pay the $30 dollar price difference if I wanted to exchange. Unbelievable. The product is good but I never liked the Best buy customer service. This product met all of our my needs and I would recommend it to others. Would recommend for the right person that wants low cost tablet BUT...Ended up returning this item because it was heavy and too wide for my hand to hold. It was too big to hold in hand and too small to use like a larger tablet. Ended up just using my Lenovo Yoga 900 since it was more flexible and only about .5 lb heavier. I have the HD 7 and an HDX 7, and the 8 outperforms them both. If you are an Amazon fan of the eco system, this is a must. The screen is bright and crisp. The processor performs very well with the latest software update. I love it. Bought to use for recent travel. Was able to download several movies and TV shows from Netflix. Seems to have decent storage. Video playback was fine. Just purchased the Amazon Fire 16GB model and so far it has performed as expected. Only drawback is the screen which is somewhat reflective of any light source and needs constant cleaning for smudges from normal use. Easy to set up and use. Nice graphics and lots of apps to choose. I got this for my husband who is technology challenged and so far, he\\'s using it without getting frustrated, which is huge! love the first now a new one. everything at your fingertips. purchased for a little guy, and i am very pleased with it!! Perfect gift for the office co-workers or close friends This is actually a pretty good little tablet. It is not the most powerful and it doesn\\'t have the highest resolution screen. But for the price, you can\\'t go wrong. It does what it is supposed to do and for the low price you won\\'t feel much pain if you break it. A perfect first tablet for the kids or a nice secondary tablet that you can just toss in a bag or the car for road trips. Amazon Fire tablets are the best products in their price ranges, especially if they are on sale as they were at the last Black Friday event. Excellent purchase. I bought this as a way to easily read while on the go. I\\'m disappointed as it\\'s really too big too easily carry around. I\\'ve discovered it\\'s not all that easy to use it for reading purposes This tablet is the best one we\\'ve ever bought. And, the least expensive! It satisfies all of our needs; email, Facebook, Candy Crush, YouTube, Bluetooth broadcasting to a remote speaker. We love it. No frustration whey using the keyboard or finger clicking on icons or commands! i was surprised buy how light and compact this was but still strong enough to do what i needed. Great for reading. Ordering books and use as a tablet. For the price, this tablet is not bad. I found a couple of things that is a bit annoying. Every time you turn on the device, ads will appear in the lock screen. Also the picture gallery, it takes several minutes to load. The wait is very annoying. For the price, you can\\'t beat this tablet. It is fast and basic. I had problems with my White page and was in the process of buying ad new Kindle I found this was a better unit for my use than tine White-page. Perfect for the price. It is great to bring with you on the go. And like I said can\\'t beat the price. The only con is it has a plastic back so be careful. The battery is great. I would absolutely recommend this product. This tablet is not a high-tech state-of-the-art Speed Demon, but on the other hand it is more than good enough for daily use. The two biggest benefits to me are that it now comes with Alexa built in, and, you can download Amazon movies to the device to watch offline, for example on an airplane. These two features alone make it worth the very reasonable price. good value for the money .............................................................................................................. Gave this to my wife for Christmas. Upgraded from the original Kindle. She thoroughly enjoys it. Fire is a good tablet. Portable size . Have bought a couple for gifts as well This tablet is really easy to use and since I\\'m a Amazon Prime member the video\\'s and music is easy to access. I\\'m really surprised how fast the unit compared to my older i-pad. I would recommend this if anyone wants a good value product. This is a great tablet for the money. Perfect for someone who does not want to shell out hundreds for an iPad. like a tablet. great, fast connection. everything I wanted in an electronic reader. No problems with the fire. Works well. Just need a case for it now. Size is very convenient. I bought this for my mom and she loves it. She said it is really easy to use and loves the lighting, it\\'s easy for her to read. Very helpful and friendly. Didn\\'t have too much selection on what I was looking for. But found what I needed. This tablet is so great for the price, but Amazon has always put out excellent product. This is fairly lightweight and pretty fast too. Like all Amazon product it ties all your Amazon accounts so downloads and purchases are super easy. I have dropped it a couple of times and no damage... so it\\'s pretty tough too. It is a great and affordable tablet for my 12 & 13 year old grandsons. It keeps up with the higher speed internet. So far the tablet works great. I got this for my daughter for Christmas and she downloads games no problem. The 16gb is great I\\'m glad I purchased the larger storage capacity. very good for kids to use, play games and watch kids videos. I like that it gets 12 hours of charge time. Easy to use. i bought this on a whim because my brother recommended i try it sometimes. hard to believe how important this is in my life. this has opened up my long forgotten youth with music and videos anytime Was looking for a cheap tablet for my a son to use saw this unit on sale on black Friday good unit. Basic internet plus a ton of Amazon apps and some standard ones too. If you want to use Amazon it is an excellent tool. Easy setup. Confusing screens but practical and inexpensive. Really enjoy this product. Love watching movies and playing games on my Fire HD 8 Great rablet, clear screen and small design. Great for watching movies. Great for keeping around the house and doing basic Internet functions. For traveling it lets you bring books, movies and/or tv shows via Amazon so being Amazon Prime is a plus.For you business travelers, out of the box it can open, view, & edit MS Office files, .docx, .xlsx, & .pptx.All this for 25% the price of a iPad. Yes, the iPad can do more, but do you need it? I pulled the trigger on the fire tablet knowing the I would have to install the google play store separately. with some work this could be the most bang for your buck for an android tablet. Purchased for my niece for a Christmas gift. She loves it no complaints Best tablet money can buy for under 100$. Very happy with its performance and responsiveness. External speaker is much better on this than my more expensive samsung tab E tablet. I use it at home instead of a computer. I gave it four stars instead of five because it seems to lose wifi frequently. However this could be due to house wifi issues. The tablet is fast and easy to use. Love the ease of downloading books. Got this tablet on sale for $59.99 at Best Buy and got Webroot Internet Security free with purchase. This is not a high end tablet but it works really great for many of the things I do. For the price it can\\'t be beat! Easy to use and portable. Took on vacation and it was great to kkep up on emails and news. Really handy. Can check email, read a book. Also can access info on the web. Lightweight. I was hesitant to buy a Fire tablet but I just needed an extra around the house tablet and I was very impressed. If you need a tablet just to browse the internet, watch movies and light basic searches its perfect. Purchased the device for my son to take full benefits of his prime account. A decent device with reasonable features for the low cost. Bought this for my 5 year old son. He navigates through apps and sites easily. The built in Wifi is helpful for car rides. Parental controls blocks him from buying every download he finds attractive. We\\'re still trying to figure out how to get Alexa to audio respond. This product is very easy to set up and use. Has lots of great features that make it fun and easy for kids to play games and read books. Bought this as a Christmas gift for my wife. She is an avid reader. She previously had a B&N Nook which stopped working. This is much nicer and she loves it. Would recommend for someone who likes to read while traveling or simply at home. Bought this tablet for a child at Christmas. After days of research, this tablet seemed to be the best buy of the lot. It had a good processor, decent memory, and good reviews. It should be exactly what a 12 year old would need in a tablet at a great price. I was looking for and cost effective solution to satisfy my childrens desires to have there own SmartPhone to play Games.I like the Parental controls, to limit certain actions and downloads. Great easy tablet for a reasonable price. Not the most super powerful. It can get the job done for simple tasks such as surfing the web, checking email, playing YouTube, etc. screen is clear and responsive. Great inexpensive tablet It was a gift for my granddaughter and she seems very happy with it so far. Purchase for a 12 year old. Sturdy, easy to usr. Great price I gave this as a gift for Christmas and still can\\'t get it set up will have to go to geek squad to help This tablet is great and easy to use. Great way to keep the kids entertain. It replaces my 6\" Fire Kindle. Love the HD quality. Owned a kindle fire HDX for GameCircle years. Finally decided Goodreads upgrade. This fire HD 8 is great. Really Prime the larger screen and new features. Amazon tablet that links to my amazon prime account so that i can watch all my movies and listen to my music. Grandson used a borrowed one at school. So now has his own . Great tablet for children and for entertainment... This is a great tablet for the price it is offered at. Great for amazon prime members. my third amazon fire, has more features than my old one. battery lastlonger Pretty good tablet especially for the price. That being said, it could be slightly faster when opening apps and running certain processes. Overall good machine for the price. Nice size. Good processor speed. Not happy that I cannot gety Google music. I think that my Amazon tablet does all that I need for it to do.Handy to have when traveling.Easy to operate. While this tablet doesn\\'t have the screen resolution that I\\'m used to it\\'s a nice beginner tablet. Faster than my old Fire HD tablet I purchased years ago... Great value. Daughter loves it. Easy to use and navigate for her. I bought the 8\" version on impulse because of an excellent offer on Black Friday. As an Amazon product, it offers Amazon apps. While you can get Google Play apps, it requires some hoops. I just discovered I can\\'t save movies from Netflix because that only applies to the HDX version. So this product has limits. But used as a Kindle reader, or to get email via wifi, or other uses (wifi only) while traveling where you wouldn\\'t want to take an expensive device, it is a good choice. This is such a wonderful value for the money!!Clear display with great color!! Tablet is wonderful for young kids. There\\'s ways to switch it to kid friendly This was a Christmas present so it hasn\\'t had a lot of use yet but so far this tablet has worked well and was straightforward to set up We bought one of these for our 2 year old a few months ago and we liked it so much we bought one as a Christmas present for a 65 year old parent. It obviously isn\\'t the highest quality tablet on the market, but it very responsive and gets the job done. And, you can\\'t beat the price; just a great value.

(a different make) Beautiful picture. Enjoying different apps and looking forward to hours of fun. Works well. Easy to use. I like the auto on when you open the case I bought this for my son for Christmas. He loves it. He can use it to access the web. This item is great for kids, it is education. You canaccess over 13,000 books on amazon. It has helped my son with his reading.

Screen is easy to read from. purchased for my mom and showed her a few apps and she took to it without further direction Nice tablet for the price. Being amazon prime member, I am using many amazon services and devices, tablet is really handy for managing it all very easily apart from other basic functinality of tablets. Had a Fire 7 previously which was ok but this one is brighter, faster and the larger keyboard makes a huge difference. Bought this tablet for my mom who struggles with technology. The Fire HD8 was easy to setup and has many great features. She is catching on well and learning new applications daily. A great value. I\\'ve never had a tablet, I-phone, Smartphone . . . Nothing but PCs. This is my first foray into these modern electronics. I must say that, while I still find it very nerve-wracking, this Amazon Fire Tablet has been pretty user-friendly for an old man like me. I\\'m learning something new about it every day. Got it for my grandma. She loves it , has no complaints about it. For the price you can\\'t beat this tablet for kids. I\\'m not a fan of Amazon\\'s super restricted App Store, but the device itself is very good. I love the curfew feature. You can set up times that a child can or can\\'t access the tablet without your permission. This is so much easier to travel with than the lap top. Gave to my Grandchildren for Christmas, would like to get another for the same price for another Grandchild. I took a couple of pictures with the camera and when I went to view them I can\\'t seem to find the pictures. When I bought my tablet they transferred what I had on my 7in but some of the apps didn\\'t transfer. I\\'ll have to come in and have it explained.Other than that I am very pleased with it. Bought this for my gf since she is on her phone playing games etc. I\\'ve used it a few times and like it. Got this for my 11 yr old and my main concern was parental controls. Parental controls are an awesome feature and were easy to set up. Amazon had plenty of free apps for kids that i didnt need to purchase extra. Thank you I\\'m very happy with this purchase! We purchased these because we really liked the price. We also bought protective cases for both and an antivirus program for them. Bought this for my mom for Christmas. It is her first tablet. She loved it, and will have no problems learning to use it. Very straightforward and easy to pick up. Great storage, fantastic resolution and really good features. i really like this tablet..easy to use and looks great. Great tablet for the price, I would definitely recommend the higher gigabyte as it downloads quickly and doesn\\'t take time to upload. It has great picture quality, all the applications seem to load very fast. The device is a good item and I really recommend to everyone This Kindle was purchased on the black friday sale. At the time I felt it was a steal at that price. The first tablet I purchased a few years ago was the original Kindle Fire, the following year I purchased an iPad mini and now have the iPad mini 4. As you may already know, the iPad does not have explandable memory. This Kindle can have expanded memory to 200GB so that was a good selling point for me. After setting this new Kindle Fire up, I noticed that viewing photos were not as clear as the original iPad mini even without retina display, and the color had a greenish-yellowish tint to it. Some may not notice this if they do not have something else to compare it to. I\\'m a pro photographer so this was quite unaceptable to me. I was not expecting perfection with the colors but people\\'s skin tones appeared greenish as if they were Vulcans. I also like to read tech manuals and magazines of which many are in PDF format. The Kindle will read this format but the Kindle Fire after all these years still cannot display the cover art from pdf books, etc.; it displays an acrobat pdf document logo instead. If you have a large library of pdfs you have to read through the document titles instead of being able to select by seeing the cover of the book. That was enough for me, I\\'ve been spoiled by the ease of use of the iPad and the display with accurate colors. Back to the store for a prompt refund it went. Overall..still a good deal but if you are used to an iPad for the reasons I am..you may be disappointed. Works well. But does not offer access to the apple or android App Store. Without the apps that I need, this tablet is not as useful. this Amazon fire tab works really well.the syncing aspect is very nice being able to pair it with all my devices.i wish it had Google play. It\\'s a really good gadget ...I love everything about it... I would definitely recommend it to others since it is a good value for money product. Nice easy-to-use tablet. We just got it and so far so good Easy to use and please send me a $50 gift certificate for filling out this survey or cash works too. I bought this for my son. He been reading books and searching stuff on line and watching youtube on it. He said it didn\\'t hurt his eyes like the iPad. great product I would recommend this tablet, grest price This tablet is by far one of the best purchases we\\'ve made for my son. The kids feature is extra nice! While the Fire hd8 tablet certainly will not perform like some of the more expensive units, for basic web surfing, email, and especially shopping on Amazons web site, this tablet performs well, although it will occasionally freeze while surfing some sites. The screen resolution is what I would call \\'adequate\\', but not on par with other high resolution (and far more expensive) tablets out there.Overall, I am pleased with this tablet-so far. Purchased this Kindle Fire HD8 from Best Buy. My fiancé downloaded her first book. She already started reading and said it is really cool to use. She said it is easy to see and navigate. I have enjoyed using the Fire HD. It is fast and easy to use. I also appreciate all the things it will do. The kindle fire hd is a sweet tablet for reading and apps like netflix or hulu. It does everything my kids need without having to pay a ridiculous price. The kindle is great not only is it a reader its bascially a computer. It connects to the internet it takes pictures and has many other great features. very satisfied with tablet, very fast and efficient I really enjoy using this tablet it runs very well Tons of value, if you want a budget tablet look no further. We purchased this tablet for our son for Christmas, to replace a malfunctioning Kindle Fire 7. We like Kindle for our kids for the parental controls. So far, this Kindle has performed fine. He seems happy with it. Really crisp picture. Fast and good amout of storage. I got the kindle fire hd8 for my daughter for Christmas and she loves it very much The product is quite durable and user friendly in many aspects. This is our 4th kindle and we love them as \"beginner\" tablets for kids! No worries of data overages and with the sd card slot memory will no longer be an issue! My 10 year old has enjoyed playing on this. Great selection of apps and games. did not expect this kind of quality for the price I paid. very surprised. nice product. First off I can\\'t get over how much I like this one. The battery life is great the screen is nice and clear .... and bright. I would buy it again if anything ever happened to it. great compact tablet with great coclors and resolution-----decent battery life and good wi fi connectivity I love this tablet! It\\'s the perfect size. I can do everything on it and it was affordable! Can\\'t beat for price,feels expensive but isn\\'t. Does all the basics I love this tablet. The screen is so clear. So easy to read a book on. I\\'m loving my kindle fire. It does everything I need it to do and more. Works well but lacks forward control of screen and right and left movement on keyboard. Good foor short notes but could never do any substantial typing on this without external keyboard. Good for basic websurfing and email. The 8\" version is much better than the older 7\" version. Better graphics and faster processor Better then a E-book, more options and versatility I haven\\'t used a product like this and man I have to tell u it\\'s better than apple products This was exactly as advertised and did everything that was claimed. Setup was fast and easy and I have no complaints. Love this tablet for streaming, facebook, games and general web surfing. The apps are available on the amazon underground, not google playstore, so some apps that you may be used to using, may not be available on amazon underground. Overall, great tablet for the price. Would recommend. The screen is vibrant and clear. It is fast and doesn\\'t lag when going onto different sites. If you have Amazon Prime this is the tablet for you as it gives you access to unlimited, music, movies, and tv. Awesome purchase! Great size and storage for reading my online books Great price on a good tablet... especially on Black Friday The HD8 is a Great tablet. I purchased two for my daughter\\'s. The tablet feels durable to touch. The screen picture is crisp and clear. My grandson loved it. I had the smaller one but wanted to larger one for him. I received this as a gift. One of the best I\\'ve ever received. I bought two of these Fire Tablets for gifts for my sons. They are both thrilled with the features. They use them for gaming, music, photo albums, emails and online activities. The HD is what sold me. I have a Kindle Fire 2nd generation and I enjoyed mine so much since 2012, I looked into getting this one. I gave my husband this tablet for Christmas. He is very pleased with the product. He likes it much better than the last tablet that I purchased him 3 years ago. He highly recommends the product. Purchased due to reviews and in sale. So far easy to use. The Fire HD tablet is a good product. The screen has good viewing angles and the display is on point. However, the major issue I have are you have to be online to make any setting changes to the tablet.; and the advertisements that show up on the home screen is a downer. So, the rating of a 4 star is pushing for me. It\\'s such a great tablet !!! Love the picture and everything about it is amazing. I\\'m glad I chose this one and what a great deal I got on Black Friday Bought for a 6 years old she loves it and is always on it great starter tablet My 6 year old got it for Christmas and is able to use it very well Gift for daughter. She loves it. Just opened so as far as I know it will be a great purchase. Great product as usually ... better screen and faster than my previous. Work with my chromecast .. easy to use This my second kindle .. it\\'s light and faster than my previous kindle ..came with free audio books for 30 days which is cool ... better screen .. it does seem to be long than wider .. which I\\'m ok with and I got this on sale for 60 .. great deal I used to watch youtube on my phone and wife decided I needed something bigger. I seem to like it very much. I did buy a micro sd card for it. I previously had a nook that died and tried the Fire and I was hooked. Great price and lots of things to do PICKED THIS TABLET UP ON BLACK FRIDAY. WHAT A GREAT DEAL. WORKS AWESOME AND HAS ALL OF THE AMAZON APPS. Second one, bigger, better, easy as pie to set up. I bought this orange Fire Hd8 on Black Friday so it was at a great price. My husband likes it a lot. It was purchased as a replacement for his previous Fire 7 tablet that was having charging issues. I\\'ve heard of a several others having the similar issues so hopefully this model lasts longer and has an improved charging port. Bought it for my dad who loves tech that his life easier the alexa integration is fantastic. Purchased this as a gift for my father and he\\'s loving it. bought two for the family and they connect easily and work surprisingly fast for a small price. I use my fire hd8 to download books from the library. Easier to read than on my smartphone. We bought this to replace my children\\'s aging Ipads and they\\'re very happy. I was looking for a easy to use tablet for a beginner and this met my needs . Bought this during black Friday sale offer, was a good purchase and cheap. The Kindle Fire HD is an impressive Product. It is faster than my Samsung tablet. I know I will enjoy using it. I just wish that Amazon Prime music had a downloadable app for it. It is great , I like it very much. I can find anything you want. Enjoy the pad and its options. Its a great starter pad for kids. Downloading is a breeze, works quick and effective for what I bought it for. Very pleased. if you had a kindle fire 1st. this one is mush better.with all the new stuff inside . I bought two of these for the grandkids, I was going to show them how to set them up, didn\\'t need to! ilovemy kindle 8\" . However it has crash a couple of times and am not sure why. also the 8\" case is not made for this kindle because the clamps used to hold it are right on the buttons to turn on and volume. so if you have a better case for it please let me know. Works very well. Cheaper than an iPad and works great for apps and video. This was so easy to set up and the print can easily be adjusted to extra large. My 78 year old dad was really happy with his first experience with technology. He is now surfing the net and reading news online. Highly recommended. horrible...just like the other 7 i have owned ONLY due to warranties I got 2 of these for my 8 and 9 year old daughters and I love them and so do they LOVE BEING ABLE TO MAKE SPECIFIC PROFILES FOR MY CHILDREN We love the kindle fire HD8. it can have various profiles to accomodate all people who uses it in our family household. it is also very easy to set up Bought this Kindle because of the great price. Good thing, because I dropped the other one without the case on it and it cracked. I purchased this as alight weight replacement for my laptop. It has accomplished everything I needed. I\\'m sure there will be something\\'s I still need HP for, but this is a great tablet for what I needed. I got a case and 64gig card also. Everything works seamlessly so far. I upgraded my mother\\'s 3rd generation Amazon Kindle Fire HD 7\" to this new one and she likes the display being bigger to 8\" and is much faster. My husband bought this on Black Friday at a really great price! He loves how lightweight this is, and offers him his email, internet functionality and books, of course. Great buy! This fire is much better than the old one so far. It responds much faster and has a much better screen. I also put a 128 gig memory stick into it which the old fire could not accommodate. So far, so good. This was purchased an a reward for a job well done. Set up was easy and the functionality was perfect for my needs. I found this to be a great tablet for all ages-easy to use-great content. You cannot get a better tablet for the price and Best Buy had it on sale. Daughter loves it. Everything transferred from her Kindle to the fire. She said it is unbelievable fast. This version is a really good upgrade over the older fire tablet that we had before. Very happy with it. It is awesome play pokemon and clash use silk its awesome great present I bought as a Christmas gift for my 9 year old and she loves it. It works great and my package arrived early with no issues. I purchased this item for my son as a Christmas gift. His eyes lit up as he unwrapped it on Christmas morning. Later in the day, his older cousin had to call me and verify if he had truely received this item as a Christmas gift... I also plan on taking Best Buy up on their e - mailed offer that I received, which states that I can receive free start up service to get me started with my tech purchase. One of the best tablets on the market for its value Bought this for my six year old son for a Christmas present and he loves it. He couldn\\'t be happier it keeps him very entertained. This tablet was such a good deal definitely no complaints here. Best buy has the greatest deals love this store. Strong fast tablet. My 8 year old can manage it perfectly! Does what I wanted it to do. Really like the way it performs. Does not let me connect with my library. Very diapointed I purchased this for my wife so that she has an option other than her phone or laptop to browse the internet. I Love this tablet its Awesome and way Cool I highly recommend this to anyone Great price great value for the pricing...black friday special Inexpensive, No need to worry about it getting broken/lost It is very handy great when i don\\'t want to use a computer and i can take it anywhere Bought it for my wife and the fire does not have to be recharged as often as the paper white. she likes it bought this during black friday (actually Thursday). ok for price. but not cool i had to buy extra storage for not a great price. I started with the 7\" little brother and liked it a lot, so I decided to upgrade to the larger model. I use it primarily as an e-reader and for some net surfing and Facebook. The WiFi works great and is ready to access and use. Don\\'t buy this unit if you want cell (4g) access to the Internet. It is WiFi only. Frankly, my cell phone takes better pictures, but that\\'s not what I really wanted from the unit. All in all, a great reader with excellent battery life. A great alternative to the more expensive iPad. I prefer my paper white for reading but this is great for everything else. Great gift idea. Nice addition to the kindle family. So far it does what I want. Very happy with the price too. I read the reviews, before I purchased this item and.... So far, so GOOD! The handy-dandy case that I found on sale for 9.99, at the same time works well too. I\\'ve owned a Kindle Fire HD7 before and this newer Kindle fire didn\\'t disappoint. It does the job really well for most things and the price you pay, but don\\'t expect it to be a top of the line tablet. Everything I needed it for. Screen is nice enough and price was right. The 8-inch screen makes it very easy to use and read the print of books. Overall quality is very good. Perfect for my wife and college daughter. Very easyTo learn reader. My Dad, retired Vietnam veteran, received this as a gift and he Loves it so much. Very user friendly and great quality for the price. Picture is great. Quick response when going from site to site. Sound is not so good but what I expected from a tablet. very easy to set up and use. seems to be good quality Purchased on Black FridayPros - Great Price (even off sale)Very powerful and fast with quad core processors Amazing soundWell builtCons -Amazon ads, Amazon need this to subsidize the tablet and will remove the adds if you pay them $15.Inability to access other apps except the ones from Amazon. There is a way which I was able to accomplish to add the Google Play storeNet this is a great tablet for the money I purchased this as a gift and I\\'m had I did. This tablet far exceeds my expectations. Very pleased with my tablet. Love that it\\'s HD and user friendly. I thought twice about getting this because of people saying you have limited apps but its not to limited so I am very happy. I was able to get google youtube Netflix and all the main apps I actually care about. For the price you cannot do any better. Love it so much we ended up getting my kids each one. good for reading for a long hours since battery last over 6 hours. I will recommend it to my relatives and friendas Key to owning this tablet is having amazon prime account Easy to use and navigate. Great for watching movies and videos!! Bought two of these for my kids for Christmas. Love the level of control it gives me to supervise and monitor usage. Best deal I have seen online. I checked Amazon and they were not as good. We bought this as a gift for someone who travels often. She loves it and said the quality it as expected. Great battery life and picture quality. The camera is not the greatest but I often don\\'t use it for the camera. I usually have my phone with me so I use that instead. Can hold a lot of books too. The Amazon Fire HD8 is a great tablet at a bargain price. Purchased at Christmas time for $59. It\\'s an even better value if you have an Amazon Prime account. Only downside is the use of Amazon\\'s Appstore instead of the Google play store which has more variety. I bought 3 three of these for my boys for Christmas gifts. Great little tablet. Perfect for everything they want to use it for. Greatest small tablet. Just wanted something convenient. My wife loves her Fire Hd8 she had one of the older models so i up graded her to this new model and she feel in love with it right away The amazon kindle fire is a great reader on a budget. It has most of the basic functions of standard tablets(Ipad, galaxy tablets) at a fraction of the cost. It also has access to a huge amazon library of books. We got 2 of these tablets in black Friday for a great price! its a pro if you have amazon prime, since everything around this tablet is amazon base- shopping, videos, books, and alexa. Bought this tablet for my kiddos. Pretty good, easy to use Always a good price and good for what it\\'s meant for. Amazon Fire is great for reading my Kindle Books, checking email, facebook, or checking out the internet. Haven\\'t ck\\'d out what else I can do with it, but I\\'m sure there is a lot. Love the Amazon Fire HD tablet, easy to get around Download games, movies, education apps to help ur kids to learn to read do math problems and keep them entertained while on the road or family trips These are excellent to keep on the coffee table or taking along on a trip. Can\\'t beat the price. Definitely worth the investment...I may get a couple of more! My daughter had a smaller eight GB tablet ... this was a nice step up for her and with better graphics. We extended the memory with an SD card for photos. Bought for my son and he enjoys playing in it. He\\'s able to download all the apps he wanted and the camera is awesome. Love this Kindle. It is my fourth kindle and it is best one yet. This tablet works great and my daughter loves it. Only reason not 5 stars is because you cant access google play without rooting the tablet. Way to ruin android amazon. i use the hd8 for my personal entertainment system I have had many tablets, Samsung, Asus and old Ipad. This Fire holds its own . The Silk system is not quite as speedy but the lack of bloatware is nice. There is a hack to get more google apps. It\\'s light to hold, the ads are not invasive. I enjoy taking advantage of the Prime benefits. Simple to operate. Would recommend for everyday use and movie/reading music consumption. Christmas gift so it\\'s to early to tell, arrived on time Christmas gifts for 2 granddaughters. They loved there first ones. time for a update There are better tablets, but at this price point the Fire HD 8 is outstanding. Reasonably priced and great for the grandkids. We purchased cheaper tablets for them last year and none of them lasted! So far these are looking 100% better. This baby is a bargain. Very good screen, decent overall quality and performance...and now Alexa. I use it with Bluetooth speaker and it has become my office music machine. Hold the home button and ask Alexa to play easy jazz. No muss; no fuss. Improves upon \\'regular\\' Alexa because she has a screen now!. I got exactly what I was expecting with this purchase, a low cost device for media consumption (e-books, movies, music) with surprisingly decent performance in the few games I\\'ve tried on the device. The MicroSD expansion card slot is a must-have for me when purchasing any tablet device. This was a gift for grandchildren. I am sure they will love, seeing they used the older one we have. Most people will go with a bigger more sofisticated iPad or Samsung but this is a good product for a child to pass time or someone not wanting all the bells and whistles Perfect cheap device for kids and grandkids nice to have sitting around This Fire HD 8 is my first such device. I find it to be easy to operate and very responsive.The touch screen control takes getting used to as I often click on the wrong close part of the screen and have to go back. The Alexa voice assistant surprised me when she announcedherself over the speaker. (I shut her off since I\\'m not a fan of conversing with computers).My main complaint is that comes with nothing but a charger and cable. The wordless, pictorialstart up instructions were primitive and vague. There are no instructions on how to use thisdevice; no sample book to test and get familiar with. There is a help function thatfills in some basics of functionality but not thorough enough. The WiFi connectivity is great, using the latest protocol and encryption. It has a simple web browser but web time also seems to be the greatest drain on the battery. The cable can be used toattach to a Windows PC and transfer files (books, music, pictures etc). I would also recommend buying a protective case for if its ever accidently dropped. This Fire tablet is a nice upgrade to the one I purchased 3 years ago. The screen is great, it is very fast, has lots of storage with the SD card, and just an all-around good product. And a great value. This tablet is an easy device to download sites and convenient too! Purchased the 8 inch Fire tablet during Black Friday and have been using it since. A great deal. Doesn\\'t disappoint. Nice features. Owned two prior to this one. Very nice tablet. This is my first tablet and I\\'m excited about learning how to use it. I have not used it a ton yet but I am very happy with my experience so far. This is great for an 8 yr old. She had out grown her Nabi and likes taking pictures this does just the trick. The memory can be extended to hold more pictures. Great tablet. I started out with an original kindle and wanted one with backlight and the price was too good to pass up! I LOVE my fire! I subscribe to both Amazon Prime and Netflix, and it\\'s perfect for those. Plus you can add additional memory cards. I have bought iPads for everyone in my house, and bought this for myself and am in heaven. The camera isn\\'t good though, but I don\\'t use it. For the money, this is an incredible value. Black Friday deal. Great alternative for my 2 IPads. Great stuff to have. It is a good tool to help your kids go out and find knowledge! And this does help. Wanting knowledge should still be encourage. First time user and very pleased. Great for me because of my book downloads. Not too big and not too small. This Kindle fire is amazing. I love how kindlely and fiery it is. Great value for such a well made tablet. Everything you need for a low price I purchased this tablet and am very happy with it. We bought this Fire HD to replace an older model and the kids love it. Ease of use and the integration with Amazon Prime makes the product worth every moment. It is mostly used to watch movies and play some games so it works well for what is needed. Great for the price but if you need more options as far as productivity goes you may want to stick with an iPad or Galaxy Tab. This product my not fully compare to more expensive tablets, but Amazon has made improvements that provide a platform to watch media and read. Further, Amazon has made significant strides to provide a music platform which also improves the value of this tablet. Loved the Fire HD7 but the latest HD8 is sharper, faster and still handles great. Easy to use tablet. Good price. Great for beginners as well as intermediate users. Fun! Great product simple easy to understand great value!!!! I bought this tablet as a replacement for my wife\\'s Fire TV HDX 8.9 as her battery life is starting to decrease as it is getting older. Unfortunately, she was not happy with it as the tablet is slightly smaller screen wise (the next step is 10\" which is way too big, and has 4 less hours of battery life) and I was disappointed despite it being a newer tablet it was not able to decode HEVC, like the Fire TV 2015 boxes we have connected to our televisions. This unfortunately is a show stopper, as we can\\'t view the movie library we have on this tablet. We will wait until a newer version comes out that is improved. Great price and good quality screen image in a nice 8\" format. I installed a 128 GB microSD card with no problems. I was impressed with the quality of the device and it fit a generic tablet cover that was too big for the 7\" generic tablet I had previously purchased. I wished I had gotten a few more during the black Friday sale. It came with a charger and cable. Great tablet/e-reader. You can do a lot on this bad boy!! Great all around Tablet. Does a little bit of everything along with being the best e-reader around. Great quality and decent price. Love features and the fact that I can mirror my tablet on my tv with firestick. Perfect for teenage tablet, perfect for homework!! This tablet is well worth the money. It has descent performance and good screen resolution. And it is definitely a great tablet for beginners. This is the one for those who don\\'t want to spend more on tablets. Really great product. It\\'s pretty good! Did what I needed? I love this tablet. It does pretty much every thing my ipad does!!!! Hoped this Fire HD 8 would be faster than my old HD Fire...not so much, I guess I expected the new Fire HD 8 to perform better but it still lags and is slow to load information while surfing the Internet. My wife\\'s Ipad is light years ahead on this one, but what do you expect from a 60-70 dollar tablet. It works well for what I needed. I purchased for great price on black Friday. My mom had been wanting one for a while, so this was great. The 8 In Fire tablet does everything my nexus 7 tablet did; but also has the added benefit of expandable storage. Great budget tablet. Just needs good sized microsd card! Nice tablet for media consumption for the price. For Amazon user for sure I\" like it a lot, easy to use , A big improvement over the original, the price was increideble (black friday special)onclude a camera , front and rear, the quality is not as good as a cell phone, but is ok This tablet does everything it said it would. Works great. No complaints. I just wish it played .avi, but that is not really a huge problem I purchased this kindle on black friday for $60.it works very well as a reader and tablet. It has good battery life and silk is a decent option for a browser. I also side loaded the nook apponto this kindle. It works as well here as it does on my nookereader. The Amazon Fire HD8 16GB is a excellent value and performs accordingly for it\\'s price-point. It cannot be compared with a mini-ipad at a fraction of the price. The other drawback is the , limited apps as compared to the apple store or even google store. Yes, the google store can be loaded with a little difficulty. All in all for the money, it;s a nice little tablet. Has all of the functions of the expensive iPads and works great for fraction of the cost!!! After looking at several similar products, and looking at multiple reviews, the Amazon Fire HD 8 seemed like the best choice. The fact that it was on-sale one-third off on Black Friday made the final choice easy. We are very pleased with how this product works and how it met our needs for a bit larger screen. Easy for us mid-seventy year-olds to use. Upgraded my tablet to hd, previous owned the 7\" regular. I wanted a tablet so my grandkids can use instead of using my ipad. A great xmas gift. Very user friendly and straight forward instructions great for all ages I had a smaller version and this was easy to adjust to and use. Really affordable present for a kid.. Or just have around It\\'s a great tablet for the price. Fast and snappy This is a nice and cheap android device. HD display and Amazon\\'s sturdy build quality with 10 hours+ battery backup. Sometimes runs a little slow, rest is good Upgrade to my kindle fire 7, pleased with all the new features including Alexa I enjoy my Kindle immensely, so much better than having to start up my computer. Bought on Black Friday for my kids, my 3 year old can work it just fine with the kids app for watching YouTube and other videos. I picked this up as a doorbuster for my father-in-law. He has an Amazon account and can watch the movies he likes. My kids like it very much! The price is low. The tablet is light weighted. Love my Kendal but cannot find a case or screen saver for it. I am very satisfied with this tablet. I use it for browsing because the screen is larger than my phone. Caught it on sale and bought two. Good value for the money. It was recommended by a friend. Get a case for it, it is easier to hold on to. The second one will make a nice gift. This is an older tablet. I probobly expected too much. If I\\'m going to deal with lagginess I prefer my ipad2. Got this thing around Black Friday and only paid about 50 something bucks. Awesome equipment you can actually stream the web very glad I bought it can\\'t believe it so inexpensive! Great product...great price very easy to use...I got it for my nieces..they love it It is good. Some apps are not available. Easy to use. This was a gift for one of my granddaughters. She just loves this Kindle. This is the second one I\\'ve bought for her. This is a bigger and newer generation with lots more options. Fun to use and also easy for kids to use as well! Good tablet for books and games for all the family! Great tablet, perfect size, has night mode on display so you would be able to fall asleep if using at night - won\\'t keep you awake because blue light is filtered out. Response is great, colors IPS panel great, no blue tooth It\\'s a really great tablet. It even has Amazon Alexa built in, so I don\\'t have to buy Echo or Echo Dot. I originally bought it to use as a MP3 player but has so many features, I haven\\'t added any music to it. Very good for kids to learn and play games and research school work. Purchased these for my grandkids...and they absolutely love them. They can play play their games to their hearts\\' content. They ar ed really fast too. Great tablet for kids to use! Play games or read books and isn\\'t slow. I got this kindle because I broke my Fire 7\\'. It took some getting use to since the screen was bigger but overall it was a great purchase. Pretty happy with this so far. Like the fact that you can add memory. I love my new kindle fire HD8!!! It is a great tablet for all ages and easy to navigate!!!! I highly recommend this tablet for everyone!! Used for internet surfing . Does a great job, it\\'s great! Perfect price for the tablet and recommend for kids who don\\'t take care of electronics. Purchased a I-Pad and the kids broke it and was out $600.00. If they break the tablet I can purchase another on at the low cost at Best Buy. Picked this up during Black Friday and for the price is a great starter tablet for my kids Our tablet is fast and works very well. I am pleased with the amount of apps that Amazon offers. This tablet is really good for the price, especially on the holidays. If you are a movie watcher or just using it for games it has great speed with a quad core. Highly recommend so e-book as well. Very happy with my purchase I bought 3 already. My amazon fire is amazing, it is fast and is durable. Great table I pay cheap price is gift for my son my son is happy My daughter loves this tablet. Uses it for Netflix! So impressed with the battery life on this! My phone\\'s battery is almost dead in the morning, but this thing can play music for 8 hours and the battery just goes down 20%. :) I am glad that I made this choice for both my kids: they love this gadget it has things for them to learn and play. Great thing about this is customized content for children The Amazon tablet line is possibly one of the best our there. The functionalities of android and windows with the ease of use equal to an Ipad Tmtis is the second tablet I purchased for my kids. Its perfect for all the things my kids do. Amazon fire tablet is great and easy to use. Good value! Amazing tablet for the price. Lightning quick, screen quality is great and it has a great feel to it. It\\'s only limitation it\\'s the Amazon app store. I love how you can keep up with social media and watch movies online. This is fantastic!!! My wife loves reading on the tablet. It\\'s also great for surfing the web. I bought it for friend of mine, he really liked it. Works very well. Easy to carry around & connect to wifi. needed a tv in our kitchen, wasn\\'t looking for huge or fancy for this. so the 32 inch was perfect for us Works great. Easy conversion for an aging guy without much technological experience. I bought my Fire HD just for reading. I have a Kindle Unlimited membership and wanted to keep all my books in one place. This is an amazing little tablet. How Amazon can sell these for only $89 is beyond me. And I got mine on Black Friday, so it was only $59! At that price it was a downright steal. I had the first Kindle Fire. This model is better in every way imaginable. I also own an iPad Pro 9.7\". I don\\'t try to compare the Fire with the iPad, they are completely different devices. But for what the Fire is, I love it every bit as much as I love my Pro! I bought this as an upgrade from my old Kindle. Works awesome, i can even watch movies through my Amazon Prime. Plenty of apps to choose from. Awesome little tablet. Great beginner tablet for all ages. Easy to use by all ages. Bought this for our 8 year old for Christmas. Looks like he\\'s going to love it! Bought this for my niece for Christmas. I\\'m sure she will love it! Newest version of Kindle Fire product line is a hit. Larger screen for not much money, good screen resolution and longer battery life. No problems, and I\\'m a happy reader! Only cost me $59 at Black Friday. Good deal. Way cheaper than an iPad of which I have several. This was for my young kids. The only knock I have has to do with the you tube kids app for this vs apple products. On apple, you tube kids allows you to speak your search. You only have the option to type the search in for this which is problematic for young children who cannot read or write I am very happy with my product. It\\'s nice fancy HD is very cool. I am able to see and read my books in full format now. Thank you. This is a gift to my wife for xmas, don\\'t know yet if she likes it but I can\\'t see why she wouldn\\'t I was pretty impressed with this little device. It was easy to setup and works rather well. I had also bought a IPad Air 2 with 128GB during BF for $375. After playing around with the HD Fire I returned the Air 2 because it met my needs at a much lower price. I added a 64GB SD card and am downloading movies from Netflix. The HD display is very clear. Battery life could be a little better but overall I\\'m very satisfied with it. The free stuff you get with an Amazon Prime account is icing on the cake. I dig it! Easy to set up. Perfect size. Easy to read font. Price was affordable. Great gift idea for the adults on my Christmas list. Nice size tablet. Very easy to use. Love it!!!!! Beats my laptop. Love the tablet not to small, lightweight, and is easy to use. This tablet is the best you can buy for the money. Great apps, great picture. Very nice at a great price. Love Bose products. Highly recommend. This on is much better than the original Kindle Fire it is replacing. This is a Great budget table, it has has Great features for the price I was looking for at replacement tablet and this is exactly what I needed The tablet is great the jacket not so much - doesn\\'t stand up - hate it Does everything I need thank you. Alight small package easy to take anywhere Great kindle, perfect size screen, I love using it just as much as my iPad mini and regular size iPad! Easier to travel with! This is really nice and has great clarity I like it. outstanding replacement tablet for my outdated and overpriced iPad 2 I use it everyday after work for down time......... I brought it for my grandmother and she really loves it. This is so much better than the Kindle that I purchased 3 years ago. It is much faster, and I really like how long the battery last before needing to be charged. For what it does it\\'s great for me a good alternative I wanted something for games and reading so I thought this was a great deal. I have enjoyed it so much. Passes a lot of time for me. Easy to download on too. Bought it in order to watch NBC but the NBC app isn\\'t compatible, so now I have a paperweight. Got this for my kid. Great cheap tablet. Camera aren\\'t so good but usable. Apps load quick. Love the kindles. This was a gift and a great value. I have one myself. Great tablet for my son. Live the endless library of downloadable books. If you\\'re looking for a tablet to read books & surf the Internet, this is perfect. Great for beginner and intermediate. Highly satisfied!!! awesome, great value, good quality product, I would recommend this to anyone Gift for my mom and she absolutely loves it. It was exactly what she wanted. The Amazon Fire HD8 is a super fast tablet for the money. When combined with an Amazon Prime account the true value is released. We purchased tablets for nearly every family member and linked them all through one Amazon account. This becomes an unbelievable value. This was a perfect gift for the holidays! I saw the reviews on this and immediately had to get it! I bought this on Black Friday and I have been using it for about a month. It is faster than my Fire 7 2015 most likely due to the 1.5GB vs 1GB RAM. The screen resolution is fine though not the best. At this price I am not complaining. Amazon adds some nice features as well. The advertisements are discreet and only when the fire is turned on. Not a problem at all. Even at full price this is a good deal. I bought this tablet for my 7 years old and love it. Great parental control, set up goals for the day, turns off at the time, I decided. Works perfectly and very fast processor it\\'s all i needed while away from my computer on the go and at work. Perfect for streaming and an E-reader at a great price. Love this tablet. It does everything I need it to.My problem is, I have family that falls in love with it so I give mine away. If this wasn\\'t good, I wouldn\\'t be on my 3rd one.The only thing I would change is the silly ads and even worse browser. Other than that, a solid product! We got a great deal on Fire HD 8. My kids love playing on it. This is a pretty reliable tablet especially for the price. I use most of Amazon services (Prime, Kindle, Music, Video, Alexa) and this is the best companion to access all services seamlessly. This tablet also has great features/expansion and performance. I just like reading amd playing games on it..Better then those bulky computers I have an Amazon fire tablet and love it so hopefully he will also. Pretty easy to use as your first tablet. I\\'m loving my kindle. Early gift to myself. Happy! Needed an\\xa0inexpensive and portable Alexa device and this works perfectly. Allows for reading of my Kindle lib and even plays a few games This tablet is easy to use and great for a new user. its the best tablet that you can buy for the price and you can add a memory card to it. The new Fire HD8 tablet is a great purchase for the price; it\\'s fast enough for basic browsing, and you can download prime videos to watch on the go (which is why I bought it). We use them for classes, they work great and are easy to use for our older individuals Like that downloading books is fast. I am still learning features and have not explored other positives featured. If you\\'re a Amazon frequent flyer like me, HD fire is very fun and convenient placing all aspects of Amazon at your finger tips. The only thing i dont like about it is that its slow like most tablets. does everything our other tablets do and more. Like the sharing across platforms. Purchased this for my mother. She loves it, just the right size to grab and go. Great buy for the money. I read the online reviews and compared products. Same price here as on Amazon. I liked the idea of having both my Kindle and Tablet in one. This is a great product. Very inexpensive and a great gift for children. Replaced a Nook with the fire tablet. Disappointed that I cannot use Chromecast from it. Did not realize I would be tied to amazon. But it is a good tablet so far This item is a budget friendly gift for readers and internet browsers! The gift was great since I have a 10 I knew was a good present for a very deserved person! Good speed compared to the other models just the size and weighs very little. Large viewing area for a 8\" tablet HD Works great for anything from games to movies, nice big screen to enjoy anything you are doing with it. Best gift for Beginers. Less Price and enough speed and memory. Kids like it a lot. works great for the price.but it shoves amazon stuff down your hroat like the fire tv.and is linked to your amazon 1 click buy if you haveit set up that way. I was a ook user and have been converted to kindle. The size is great and it is very responsive. Got one for me and one as a gift. I expect my tablet to be a workhorse. Available to have two or three books open that I\\'m reading, hanging on to my email and ready with summaries of the news. The new Kindle Fire does it on a larger, brighter page. It is a work horse more than worth the money.. It goes with me might and day. I don\\'t know what I\\'d without this gem. My nephew is 3 years old and this is a great starter tablet. He is gonna be so excited Christmas morning. I replaced my old kindle as it took a power failure hit. The new kindle has been updated and it is easier to download the e-books. I am learning some of the new updates but it appears to be more user friendly than my old one. Customer Service for the Kindle is available 24/7 and they are very helpful. You can get a review about any book before you purchase it. No returning books to the library. Excellent value for small laptops. Lenovo 11.2\" screens with flash memory & Microsoft Word for 1 year. This is a new tab upgrade for me as I have had my previous Kindle for over 7 years and love it. Have been very pleased with all aspects of the Fire HD8. Good performance for the low price. This was a gift for my wife. She loves it. She uses it everyday. Holds a great charge. Great little product for the price. Not the best camera, but it doesn\\'t claim to be. . Nice tablet for the price. Just wish it had bluetooth. Can\\'t beat the price on this Fire Tablet HD8! Very good display. awesome gift and perfect for kids or older adults easy to use I had an older Kindle fire and had to upgrade as it eventually died. I love the convenience of books when I travel, along with any apps I want. exactly what I was looking for. My old tablet stopped working so the value of the Amazon Fire at Best Buy was too much to pass up Bought as a gift for my daughter. and s he loves it. I was reluctant to replace my previous Kindle Fire because I wasn\\'t sure I would like it as well. I am pleased to say I\\'m loving it! I bought Kindle fire for my grandson who is 24. I have one and he thought great can do so much on it. For the price you can\\'t beat it. I use more then computer. Use it for what it is necessary. That is all I need. Great Tablet for occasional users who want to Watch Movies, Read books, and browse the web. I already own one but bought another for my sister in law for Christmas. I have really enjoyed it so far. While not perfect by any means it is certainly worth the price. Works better than what I expected. Able to surf the net and watch movies. The battery life and screen are awesome. Bought this for under 60 bucks and looking to buy more to give as a gift I purchased the Fire Tablet to temporarily replace an iPad and an LG tablet that were destroyed. My 7-year-old won\\'t put it down--he can play all his favorite games, read Kindle books, and watch YouTube videos (as long as he has wi-fi access). It\\'s holding up well. Good price. I bought this for my wife. She had a Barnes and Noble Nook, this took it\\'s place. She uses the Kindle Fire daily from reading books and playing games to looking up things on the web. She lives it. The Amazon fire hd 8 is great. Much faster than the fire 7. I am really enjoying this device, I wanted something to use for entertainment purposes when camping. Something small yet powerful and this works perfect. 5 stars if your a prime member like me that way you can take advantage of the many thing prime has to offer yet still have available almost every other digital services out there. Would and have recommended this product. Tablet had trouble from the begging it kept restarting and rebooting I had to return it. if you like the old kindle fire it just like the new one but better, better screen and more space I\\'m not going to say this is the best tablet out there,but,for my wifes needs,it is perfect. It does everything she wants to do and more. Got it for $60 during black Friday. I also have 7inch fire tablet. For few more bucks this tablet is way better than the 7 inch non HD fire. I truly enjoy this product. I have an older one but this is superb in all areas of entertainment. Good tablet. Gave as gift and person enjoys it. Recommend I bought one last year for one cousin and had to continue for another this year. Great buy imo. it is small enough to carry in your purse and open up a whole new world while waiting at appointments. Looks pretty solid will update review as soon as gift is opened . We have one for each of my children so I bought this one for my mother. They are amazing tablets especially for the price! Purchased mainly to use travelling so haven\\'t really had the opportunity to give it a fair road test at this point. It was advertised as capable of downloading movies and books so you can watch/read while travelling without burning through your data or being hit with data roaming fees or having to purchase wifi during flights. Got these on black Friday for early Christmas gifts. Very good buy on a pretty good tablet. Gift for my mom and she had no problem learning to use. The best tablet for the price! All three of my children have one & they are worth it! Purchased as a gift for my nephew He\\'s was very happy with this item no complaints Works better than the 7\" Amazon Fire tablet I have. Better screen, faster processor and bigger to boot. I bought one for my boyfriend and one for his son. It\\'s fast and easy to use. This was a gift and they love it! Its compact, they can surf the web, play games check emails etc This my 2nd Kindle. I am so happy with it. The price was right and I could not resist buying another. I like it a lot, it works well for everything I need. I would like a bigger selection of apps. Bought this for someone as a gift. They are big on amazon kindle so this was a huge plus with other features and amazon store improving. They love it.I know other tablets have kindle apps but this was an awesome price. BOUGHT MINE ON BLACK FRIDAY AND IT IS AWESOME. MY FIRST TABLET AND IT IS GREAT WITH ALL OF THE AMAZON FEATURES. my kids have this. it works okay for things like youtube or netflix. Apps take longer to load and many games that you can get for the iPad aren\\'t available on the Fire Tablet. Still say go with Mac. So easy to use and can do so much more than just read on it I received this as a gift after my original Kindle Fire started giving me trouble after 4 1/2 years and wouldn\\'t hold a charge. This new Kindle Fire 8 is fantastic! The larger size makes it easier to read. The \"buttons\" are better than the old one. I like that is has more \"perks\", i.e. camera, that my old one didn\\'t have. It\\'s nice to be able to read, play games, browse the internet, or check email or take photos. The battery lasts for days! I definitely recommend this. Bought for college student as substitute for text books. Works great! This is a Christmas gift for my granddaughter. I purchased this one because I heard a lot of good things about it and the price was great on black Friday. Got a great deal on black friday. This is the best affordable tablet for under 100. Was able to get advertisements off from Amazon and installed playstore. Wife bought a cheaper cover for this tablet. Love the Amazon environment. Want to buy another one if they come down in price again! My two oldest (10 & almost 8) love these tablets and I love the FreeTime subscription from Amazon! My Aunt is 86 and has never used a computer. She does not have internet at her house. But she loves to read and loves to learn and now will be challenged while learning to use her new Kindle. If you are in the Amazon ecosystem, the Fire HD8 is a great choice for an inexpensive tablet. Very responsive, good screen, and so far the battery life has been great. The only drawback of the Fire is the apps are only available from the Amazon App Store, not the Google Play Store. For example, there is no Gmail application to install. But that\\'s not what I use this for... Kindle reading, Netflix viewing, occasional Facebooking and light web browsing are well suited to this device. Can\\'t beat it for $89. My whole family uses these tablets. We love them and with Prime it is awesome. I like this tablet it\\'s easy to use Easy for the kids It works just right. My husband loves it too. It does well with my kids. Runs Great, very efficient for what we use it for. Got everything on here and then some!!!!!!!!!!!!!! My kids have the older model fire, smaller version. They can spend hours on it. This is bigger, better version with a larger screen size. Each child is getting a different color so they know whose is which. Durable, works great enjoy using it for books and audio books I previously owned a Samsung Tab3. As a media device (for reading, viewing, listening, playing), the HD8 is fine, even a step up in screen size, clarity, and ease of navigation. However, the proprietary nature of Amazon\\'s apps basically eliminates (for me) using it for work (e-mail, document & spreadsheet storage/retrieval/editing). Since I didn\\'t buy it for its work capabilities, that\\'s fine, but I think that would be annoying to a specific segment of potential users. At some point I will probably spring for a more-expensive updated Samsung tablet (or Windows Surface, if I\\'m feeling reckless), and the HD8 will probably be passed on to my 9-year-old. I am so impressed with this tablet. My seven year old loves its app, gaming and e-reader functions. Easy to use reading device. Looking forward to watching movies on it. Great value My girl loved it, she loves that its linked to echo It\\'s was good for handling light weight and comfortable in hand. Good audio clarity, video everything is good. But only few supportable apps. Need more apps which we use generally. Great alternative to iPad Mini. Great for Amazon Prime members I had gotten this primarily to watch movies and run some basic internet programs. I have been very pleased to date with the speed of the processor and picture quality. Just what my grandson wanted. Perfect price, can\\'t wait until he opens it Has worked out well. Very user friendly. Would buy again. Great price as well. Great tablet for the money! Thought to beat the screen resolution My Kindle Fire HD meets my reading and web needs!! This is a great device for my sons games since he was always using my iphone. Lots of good features for the Amazon member. Tablet is nice and fast. Great tablet for under $100. HD quality and it works just as good as any tablet. Bought two for my grandkids, a 10 year old boy. He does a lot of AR reading on this kindle fire tablet for school. As well as play games. He loves it and his parents are pleased with his eagerness to read. Tablet work great, good battery life. Just not a lot storage, but has micro SD card slot. Was told by sales person I could come back in a week with receipt to get $30 off (Black Friday price). Customer service lady said they don\\'t do that. I was misled. Item itself is okay. Great Kindle, my wife had the originally one and this one is better in every way. I purchased this tablet on thanksgiving day when I was already in the store buying a new cell phone. It was on sale $59. I am very pleased with my purchase. I am already an Amazon prime member so it links up to my account. I am very happy with my purchase and recommended to my brother who bought the same day I did:) I really like the Fire 8 tablet but there are some issues to be aware of. Amazon seems to subsidize the low cost of the item by requiring you to be solicited by ads and and use their apps. Every time you activate it, the screen display is a full size ad that goes away when you swipe the screen. There is no Google Play so you can only download apps chosen by Amazon at their Appstore. Otherwise, pretty cool for the money. I got this for my birthday and I love it. I love the resolution, size and blue light setting. I am now thinking on buying one for my four year old nephew as a Christmas present, I only need to buy a sleeve. This is a great gift for my 6 year old nephew. He will enjoy it for hours. Clear screen, color and size, grandson loves to play games on it and I like to have it with me to view emails during commercials while watching tv. I need a table that had more memory to start with. This fit the bill. I had a kindle before but mine did not have a camera like this one . This make it easier to capture picture instead of having to stop and use my phone. Pros: 5 Ghz wifi, supports expansion cardsCons: app store a little limited though there is apparently a workaround Other: the ads fed from Amazon are not terribly intrusiveOverall, the tablet seems to work well and is a good value, This item is perfect for online reading and internet browsing. The only con is that Amazon doesn\\'t have some of the apps that Google Play has. The camera is not very sharp , and you can not download another one . Bought for my mom, shes in love with it. Use for netflix myself love the 8\\' great size and cpu speed. Love my new kindle bought it to replace a 7 inch and I love it. Love my Kindle. It has taken over the place of my laptop completely with all other added benefits. This is our 5th kindle. We love these. They are easy to use and the screen is a nice size. They are lightweight and great for reading. Works great even in OK network areas. Long battery life and easy to use. Would definitely recommend to a friend. I purchased this for my daughter for Christmas. I own one as well and I love it. First time with a tablet, wanted one for years just to watch Netflix and basic games. Very happy, the screen looks great and the speaker is loud. So far, so good! Great HD features. Makes it easy to travel with and be on the go and see all your shows. i like the tablet only thing is im not a fan of the amazon app store. wish it had google play. I know my granddaughter will love it. She has an older one that was given to her For the most part I like the tablet. Got it for my mother. The con is you have to use Amazon for apps. The amazon fire HD is great choice for a beginner or not so tech savy person! I like the low light mode the extra memory and a great price compared to the others This fits perfect in my purse and love how clear the screen is. The price was amazing, didn\\'t find it anywhere else close the the price. Nice tablet but as usual with these items no instructions on how to get started It\\'s very good product and I recommended this to buy it. Best bang for your buck............................ Excellent pick up during the Black Friday Sales. Not too big not to small. This tablet bundled up with Amazon Prime service is a great combo of inexpensive entertainment. I had a very small nano and needed to have more space for songs that are just coming out and so far I love it. Didn\\'t really need the bigger one because I have a phone that will do most of those things. Works very well for light tablet use and great for reading. Fire 8 HD 2016 is great. Very easy to maneuver. Easy to use and transition from original Kindle Fire. Much more versatile than the original. Really glad I upgraded. Ok tablet from amazon, added Google play to device for more apps. Google how to do this. I bought this item for my nephew and he loves it. I have the old version of the fire hd and I love it as well. It\\'s way cheaper than buying an apple tablet. We haven\\'t had any problems with it. Well worth your money Bought it for my daughter and she can\\'t put it down. Great for nextflix I had a kindle for about 4 years, I\\'ve been wanting a fire hd for sometimes, because of all the features. I can honestly say that I love my fire hd. still playing with it, figuring out what I can & can\\'t do. I love the tangerine color I got. One thing for sure, some apps I have on my phone like redbox & instagram they are not in the amazon app store so I can\\'t put them on the tablet. Wish I could. Working great as a first tablet for my grandson. He loves it Very fast tablet. Large screen but can held by 1 hand. Great for movies and videos, as well as candy crush and other resource hogging apps. It starts CC way faster than my LG G3 phone. The display is very clear and crisp. The amazon android modified OS is good once you get used to it. I have one screen containing all apps, and you can put these in groups too. so 1 screen is all you will need. then you have the other panels for Amazon mandated stuff like Prime movies, music, pictures. It\\'s pretty cool compared to my previous Acer 8\" tablet with reg Android. Could not easily install Chrome, but I\\'m getting use to the SILK browser and it will work very well for my needs. Great Tablet and highly recommended. Definitely an amazing deal at an amazing price on Black Friday weekend Amazing product from Amazon within budget and get the best outcome of it It was by far the best deal out there for the money very happy I purchased the Kindle Fire 8\" after owning a 7\" for several years. I love the bigger screen and added features in this version. Bought this for my daughter. It is inexpensive and user friendly. I use it all the time while she\\'s at school. Easy to use and elegant in design. Perfect Gift for Kids. Just decent tablet... working fast, but it needs more language support and apps as well... I bought the fire 7 inch last year and this one is better. My wife and kids love it. Easy to use. Great for the price. Good product I would recommend it to everyone thank you Thought this would be a great gift for the kids and the price was right I bought this on Black Friday for 60 bucks and wasn\\'t expecting too much at that price point. This isn\\'t as good as a iPad but at that price it\\'s pretty close and worth every penny. Bought this for a Christmas gift. Have heard good things about them and it was a recommended buy. It is awesome with low price and high quality. My daughters like it very much. Had just the fire like HD better. More movies and better quality. still learning, previously used a nexus7. Like the larger screen. Reading kindle books on it is good too. Bought for our 6 year old. Great parental controls allow you to keep track and monitor use. Would recommend for others to get for their children The product was on sale for Black Friday. Serves its purpose. Quality is good and I use it with my Chromecast. Makes a great gift. My children love them and never put them down. excellent tablet for this price is wonderfull and great performance Had to buy a new kindle because on my fire hd 7 the battery quit holding a charge. Was told there was nothing you could do. It\\'s easy to use. I can check my email, play games from AppStore, headlines news, amazon deals & offers. Very reasonable price. Purchased this for my grandson. It works great and is used mainly for reading and games. Easy to setup with no problems to register and get online. I love this tablet! love my ipad , too, but this is much lighter weight and easier to slip in my purse. I went for a 32g but there were none in stock, so I got the 16 and a memory card that I will probably never need! Love it fast , pictures look fab. love the battery life fast, easy to use, very sensitive, google play store captable, I will buy again Great tablet for the cost, does all the basic functions great. These are email, web surfing, and social media. If you belong to Amazon Prime then it\\'s even better since this thing makes it easy to take advantage of the extra content you can access. Movies, TV Shows, music, books. A lot of this is free for Prime Members. Good idea and business move for Amazon as it encourages Amazon content and purchases. The tablet itself is pretty good, smaller and more narrow than an iPad. Easy to hold in one hand, screen is nice for video, reading, web surfing and email. If the iPad is setting the bar and is a 10, I would give this an 7-8. The weakest thing is the camera, it adequate but you smart phone is better. A feature it has that the iPad lacks is the ability to add an Micro SD Card for extra space. It is also much cheaper than an iPad. I bought this for my 7 year old when her Samsung tablet stopped charging. I love the design. Only problem so far is that it randomly freezes and sometimes the volume button won\\'t respond. Other than that, great for the price. Fire tablets never disappoints! Great price, used my certificate points which helpedAlways best price at best but Most of the Kindles I have purchased have been gifts, but this one was for me. It is just what I expected from the reviews. Great tablet for the money. very good product in its price range affordable and very good The tablet works fine. But speakers are not that great If you want a good cheap tablet that works this is it. For the price guy cannot beat it great for watching videos or streaming television. I love the light weight for the size! Fun tablet!!! I really wanted to give this device a chance but I did end up returning it. It\\'s a HUGE upgrade though over the cheaper 7\" version. Honestly I don\\'t think anyone should purchase that. If your budget can handle getting this version and you are heavily invested in the Amazon ecosystem (i.e. Prime member) this will make a great tablet. I think it is intended more for kids though than adults. Having iPads in the house we tried this with our toddler as a cheaper tablet for her but the interface and quirks of the Amazon OS just were not worth the hassle. Will end up seeking out a used iPad Mini 2 instead of this. Inexpensive tablet. Funtional and great for reading. It has the blue screen that make it great for reading. Great graphics for price compared to other brands. Purchased for my nephew for Christmas. I know he will enjoy it. After I read the reviews there are a variety of things he can do on it for a 13 year old. Purchased this for my nephew for Christmas. After reading reviews, I think this will be a good device for reading books and listening to music. Upgraded from a6\" inch Fire HD. For 89.00 I don\\'t think you can find a better tablet value. Resolution is very sharp, audio is good, and it is a good size. My first tablet and it is just perfect for a beginner like me. Easy to use and just the right size. I use it when I just need to check something quickly on the internet without having to turn on my desk top computer. Very fast. great tablet for a great price and size. Would highly recommend ! Great over all Tablet! Good build quality, but cheap enough for the kids to use / loose. Really a plus for travel. Install VLC media player from the amazon app store, and then you have unlimited movie options for up to12 hours. Add some head phones and that 6 hour trip to Disneyland, well it\\'s so much more tranquil for the adults. The screen is a good size (portable but large enough to read) and has excellent resolution and color quality, the wireless connection is good and the user interface is relatively clear and easy to learn. Bought two of these for my grandson and grand daughter and they love them. I like the parental controls and the apps. Perfect device for my kids. Easy to use with lots of features. We had a few other tablets for my wife and all were very poor. We returned two and landed on this one, she has LOVED it, so much more than the others in this price range. I have had two previous kindles since they where first available. I really like all the new upgrades. The screen is very crisp and clean. The color is great. Much easier to look for books. This tablet is great! Nice display, and you get the amazon eco-system. Now you can also download google play easily, so you have the best of both worlds. I was unsure about getting a tablet but after purchasing the Amazon Fire I was convinced that I had made the right choice and have been very happy ever since. I was concerned that I had a lot to learn but it came quickly to me and I really like the screen size. It was a great buy! For the low price it is very speedy and has sufficient storage space.While it doesn\\'t have Google play, the Amazon app store has most of the same apps or a workable alternatve. We are really pleased with this tablet. The color is great. At this price point it is very good. But having being used ipad the display doesnt look sharp. Amazon app store lacks content. Overall good for my 9 yr old. This is a great tablet!!! I absolutely would recommend it to a friend!! I would buy it again!! The tablet works good.. good price point .. would buy again I enjoy readi,g and Facebook using this item. I also purchased my husband one. I love my fire! Does all that I need it to and more!!!! However only four stars because I can\\'t get rid of the ads on my lock screen unless I pay $15. it does have a lot of glare but I don\\'t mind the glare too much! Speed is great lots of storage!; This table is great for social media like facebook, check emails, watch YouTube , and in general good enough for the price! It works great for all my needs to check my emails A little more space on outer edges would be great. I only use it for gaming and have had 1 real problem. At times it kicks me out of the game (popular game from EW) Otherwise great for what I do. Needs more security. But overall good purchase for less than 100$. For the price you really can\\'t beat this tablet. The picture looks good, amazon has a great game, movie and music catalog. So if your looks big for something just to view movies on, play games or surf the web get this one because for the price it can\\'t be beat! Brought it for my son & Does EXACTLY what i want it to do. Bought this as a replacement for the 7\", faster and better display.... Best upgrade I wanted something bigger than my phone for reading. I was looking at the kindle fire, and the regular kindle e-readers. I liked the paperwhite and voyager, but they didn\\'t have the ability to play audiobooks. I decided to go with the fire because even though it will be mostly used for reading, I can do many other things with it for a cheaper price. love it i got it for my kids its more durable than a apple table I love the product. I\\'m very happy but I would like even more if the page number was displayed when reading books on this tablet, in case I wanted to refer back to a certain page. upgraded my 3 year old kindle- same old. doesnt seem that great of a difference. the graphical interface still sucks but its decent for reading. I have been a Kindle Fire user for years. This new one is amazing. I like being able to store information on a SD card. We like the battery endurance. The new 8\" screen is great too. I am very happy with this tablet. It\\'s a good size for me and easy to read and use. The wifi would drop often to where I could not listen to Spotify or other services without buffering. I was contemplating to buy either the insignia 10.1 or the Fire Hd8, I\\'m so glad I chose the latter. It is so fast and sufficient for my needs. I also downloaded Google play on the tablet even making this a better purchase. For $59, you can\\'t go wrong with this purchase. Its cheap, but the you will notice the low screen resolution compared to iPad. App is somewhat limited unless you side load it. Went in to look at the 10\\' Kindle Fire and couldn\\'t resist the price on this one. There wasn\\'t a big enough size difference to justify spending more than 200.00 for the 10 inch. This has been a great device so far. Battery life, ease of use, etc I had to return my device due to WIFI signal dropping, maybe I just had a bad unit. I\\'m disappointed that it doesn\\'t have a mirror display mode. I purchased this for my dad as a birthday present. I opened it and set it up for him and it works great. It\\'s fast enough for an Internet browser, and possibly a student. I have been wanting to purchase a tablet for light web browsing, reading, and to watch videos, something easier to carry than my laptop. This tablet is fast & the videos stream in great (as long as you have good Wi-Fi connection). Easy access to Amazon too. First, I would like to say I own iPads, iPhone, and many things Apple. Second, I also own many android devices. The main reason for this tablet was to take advantage of the lending library that comes Amazon prime. Over all I would purchase this over an iPad mini any day just for the value alone. At first I thought the display wouldn\\'t be up to snuff compared to my iPad, but for movies and reading, it was good enough that it doesn\\'t take away from the experience. However, there are a few annoying \"features\" that are on but can and should be turned off. The \"on-deck\" is a great feature, but I would have liked to have known it was downloading tons of movies in the background, eating up space and bandwidth. A better function would have been to let us choose what to download, instead of getting movies Willynilly. Be sure to turn this off when you get your tablet or it will run slow, and you\\'ll be thinking the tablet is slow. Ok on to kindle for reading. Unfortunately, reading isn\\'t as great as I thought it would be because it doesn\\'t allow scrolling. Works on kindle devices but not on kindle fire devices. If you don\\'t mind flipping the page, then you won\\'t have a problem, but for me, can read much faster by scrolling. One last point, most of the apps aren\\'t as polished under the \"Amazon Store\" as in the Google play store. I know this because I have an Nexus phone and compared them. For example, the Hue app doesn\\'t even work from Amazon Store. Anyway, this point shouldn\\'t deter you from buying it cause there are solutions. Bought this for my father who would have trouble using a computer. He\\'s picking up on it very quickly. It keeps him entertained. Good reliable device. it would be nice to have full app library, but it does what you need This is a great tablet for kids and adults alike.! Got this for my 3 year old and 7 year old and they love it. I have education apps and books that reads to them or they can read along. I would recommend getting a case for it if it\\'s for the little ones just to keep it protected. impulse purchase but a good one. good fit with amazon account that we already had. nice screen, easy to navigate This gift was for my mother in law. Initially I had to help her set it up, but she loves it and can now program it all by herself. Recommeneded! For its price, this a great little tablet. It does have limitations on what it can do and what apps are available for use with it which is the only reason I gave it 4 rather than 5 stars. Hopefully Amazon will allow it to perform better soon. This suited my exact needs which was a mobile way of watching netflix. I thoroughly enjoy this table! Easy to operate, plenty of memory, and I can use it for anything that I typically use a computer for. Great for airline flights, viewing offline amazon or Netflix shows and reading books. Video quality fine for personal viewing. It has been one of the best purchases ever. It is very simple to use. This is my first android tablet. It works pretty good though don\\'t expect it to work like an iPad. The ads are extremely annoying, but that\\'s not Best Buy\\'s fault. For me this tablet is an extremely good value! iPads are beautiful things, and they seem to just work really well all the time. But they are expensive! Same thing with Android tablets. You can get a cheap Android tablet, but then you\\'re left with a cheap tablet...poor quality displays, questionable hardware, limited support. I think Amazon hit the spot with their line of Fire Tablets - this HD8 in particular. It\\'s good quality, has a great display, it\\'s quick and snappy, has great battery life. Also being an Android based operating system, there is flexibility like accessing storage, side loading third party apps, even installing Google Play (for those who begrudge the lack of that feature, it can be done). Much more flexibility than you get with an Apple product, at a much lower price than the industry standard Samsung etc. Coming from using Apple products for so long, this thing is really convincing me that there are really viable options other than Apple, and especially for the price, its a great introduction to a different platform. Not only that, it\\'s genuinely a good product! The tablet works great so far. The parent features are nice also. suggested by the sales associate I\\'m glad I took his suggestion I gave this Amazon Fire HD8 as a retirement gift for my friend and she absolutely loves it!! Bought it for my daughter and she loves it great product at a great price! Easy, fast and efficient.great lil tablet in this price range for anyone. Purchased the Amazon Fide HD8 as a gift for my dad, who has been overjoyed with it. The display looks great and it offers him access to many of the features he looks for in a tablet, from e-books, streaming video or online shopping. The price is low because Amazon\\'s OS is restrictive, but for simple or specific needs, this product is great. Got this for my wife. She uses it daily to read She really lokes it. great tablet for kids, and for the price a great value. This is a great tablet for the price. I have one that I purchased a few years ago and use it much more than my laptop. Recently purchased two more for gifts. Does the job when I travel and I would recommend to a friend This is my fifth Kindle and with each new one I have a new feature to use. I like my tablet. Been doing a lot more reading than normal with it. Only disspoinment is that my TV has automatic Chromecast and you cannot cast to it on my Toshiba TV. Works on others. TVs. I like it. Perfect tablet for my 8 year old without spending a fortune. I love how it has parental controls so I can limit his time playing. Used for reading and surfing the web, this tablet is great for all. Great screen clarity. Purchased the tablet because it was a very reasonable price. It has ended up being a good tablet. I bought this for my mom because she is too scared to even use her laptop. I thought this looked more user friendly since she knows my 5 year old nephew can use an iPad. I purchased several of these tablets during the holidays as gifts. Everyone absolutely loves the FireHD8, especially those with the prime memberships. My only regret is not purchasing one for myself. I bought this for husband for Christmas. He loves it. It fits his needs perfectly. I would recommend this product. Great product. Device performed as described. Great reviews. It\\'s easy to use and my son likes to play on it alot I bought this for my 86 year old father. he loves it. finds it very easy to use perfect gift perfect price for my wife to bring her into the technilogical modern world we live in Enjoying the kindle reading watching movies playing games Convenient and easy for my 10 year old to use to do homework on. We like it!! Would buy again.Still learning about it\\'s features. Good value Bought it for my 89 year old mom. She has enjoyed reading on it. Easy to use I needed to upgrade from the orginal Kindle fire and this Fire works great. Videos,games, email and battery life all are great. Works as expected. I enjoy reading newspaper articles, books, as well as banking apps and social media tools. I like this tablet. I had a nook, the fire has more memory, bigger screen and lower price. The downside? The Amazon Fire is so ridiculously proprietary that I cannot watch any of my movies on it from my nook. This is becoming industry standard. Too bad. I installed a driver for google play store; also I payed amazon to get rid of the lock screen ads ($15). It was worth it. I use this thing alot. Easy to use, great battery life, plenty of space and amazing screen quality. Excellent product. The screen is very easy to read and can access movies, books, and ,more. Was given as a gift to my mother and she loves it. This tablet was great. I bought it for my sister on christmas and she loves it. It is great for surfing the web and watching videos. The sound and screen quality are great and I like the blue light cutoff feature.I found that toggling back & forth online to be clumsy compared to a tablet.It is lightweight and easier to handle for long periods of time. The tablet is good for games like solitaire or other app games, and of course for books. But for internet or other applications, it would not be the top choice. Good buy for the money. My wife reads a ton, she uses it everyday. She\\'s owned others and this is by far the best. This tablet is hands down the best investment I\\'ve ever made. I used to carry a laptop to meetings, then my kids talked me into getting a tablet and what a difference. As long as there is wifi it does everything my laptop will. Hoping for an updated hdx kindle, but settled for this. Enjoy the expanded sd slot. very pleased with my amazon tablet. starting with the price ,ease of use, and size. Good cheap tablet. Great for Netflix and YouTube. Screen is a decent size just bigger than a phone and smaller than a laptop. It\\'s also HD which is a plus We love our tablets waiting recommend it to my friends Purchased to replace the one I bought for my brother in August (physical damage). This time, bought the extended warranty. No issues or claims so far! I think the amazon fire offer should include a stand/cover as standard. I enjoy mine a lot more since I was forced to purchase a stand/cover which holds the tablet. Would have preferred an instruction sheet to grt everything set up for use. Easy to access the apps, but not always easy to quit. The device works good, but since it\\'s the apps that make it what it is, more attention should be given to their operation. I was disappointed that it did not come with even a basic user\\'s guide. We are a total Apple family so I was a little hesitant to purchase this when our iPad stopped working. So glad we did because it\\'s perfect and can\\'t beat it for the price! Love using my new tablet (Amazon Fire). Easy to use. Great buy! Good value value for the money & easy to use. Bought this for my dad food Christmas and he loves it. This is a great option for a first tablet. It\\'s lightweight and user friendly. This is just an awesome tablet for the price and the features it has This little thing does everything and does it quickly. It could use a case, so think about getting one, but as an eReader it does everything it is supposed to. I so happy I can recommend this good thanks Best Buy is the number one I think I downloaded 6 new apps. I wait to surf the web. This thing is so slow to respond. My old refurbished iPad is better. I really only bought it to stream Hulu and Netflix. I\\'m not excited about lighting up the home screen to find advertisements every day, but I guess you get what you pay for. I wanted inexpensive, I got it! Don\\'t buy this if you are used to using quick responding electronics. My 10 year old uses it at school to scan qr codes and do his online math. Santa got this for my 7year old. Work\\'s great . He plays, games, gets on hulu, and can play his school education learning games. Now he doesn\\'t bother me to use my electronic devices . I have always been an iPad user but I love the kindle fire 8. It has everything you need and more and so much less expensive. Battery lasts a long time but I actually like my old Fire more. We got this for a young girl who is 9. She loves it and there a lot of Apps that she likes. There are parental controls which is a plus, recommend for almost any age group. I got everything I need for personal use. A great value for a cheap price. This was a perfect gift for my friend. Obsessed with reading and has been perfect for starting a greater library of books... Very easy to use and extremely affordable. Very happy with this purchase, and will buy more for family and friends! I love it for reading magazines and checking my email. This tablet is sturdy and great for my kids with games and learning. I love my kindle fire it holds a library of books that I can read anywhere. I change from my kindle fire to my phone if I don\\'t have the kindle with me. So I can start right where I am in the book and then finish up on my kindle fire when I can. I play games and listen to books all on this device. Love it It\\'s good for doing a number of basic tasks. The Amazon Underground feature is really cool. It feels like an Android but more limited. Great for reading e-mail, pictures or viewing internet. Great item, I can say it feel just like working with an iPad. Picture, sound, size and touch are very sweet. this is a great tablet for under $100 and you can add kodi on it, to me thats the best feature and the duel sided camera Got this as a gift for my Mom who reads a ton. She loves it for reading and great portability. Great tablet for the price. Great for media consumption. Screen seems sharp enough unless you get unbearably close to it. Wifi connectivity is good. Speakers sound poor but I didn\\'t expect any better from an 80$ tablet. Have had this tablet since November and is still going strong. Only complaint is the slow charging. but it isn\\'t too bad. This is a nice compact size, and is very user friendly! .Great resolution. Camera quality not so good tho. Gave it one less star for the camera. But overall its a great tablet I love it a lot and use it daily, bought books.... I got theses tablets for my grandkids for Christmas, they love them. My granddaughter loves her tablet. She has learned how to play both educational and recreational games. Will be very helpful in the future. Great tablet for the price easy set up and app and data transferring from the original Fire. My 5 yr old loves it, however we do experience some sound issues from time to time. This was purchased for my 9 year-old to play games, watch movies, and read on. When we set it up, I was extremely impressed with the quality that we got for the price! It\\'s processor is fast enough so that his games run smoothly. Setup was a breeze, and it\\'s very sturdy. This is a great lower price tablet for anyone looking to own a nice tablet for an extremely affordable price. Purchased for 4 yr old granddaughter who primarily uses for Netflix. Works great! the fire tablet is a nice size and is easy to use it is better then the 7in fire Not much to say here. Cheap, fast and very functional. I was able to install google play store and everything works perfectly. Best tablet in its category. If you want something better, you better be ready to pay 3-4 times the price. This tablet exceeded my expectations. Strong processor, nice screen. Wish it had Bluetooth and was not so centered around Amazon prime. Great item. My teen lives it. This item offers more than just reading. Tablet was college student. Replace a bulky laptop. Good for taking notes, reading text books and regular books. Loud alarm to wake college student for early classes. All a round got tool for school. its very easy to set up and use. love to take it with me . screen its large enough to read easy on it my 7\" wore out,my 8\" is much better,allthough the covers are expensive and screen protectors are hard to find. the battery life is exceptional ! Was looking for a tablet with expandable memory that was reliable. Amazon Tablet was the best choice Very easy to use. Size is just right --not cumbersome at all. Cannot beat the value and features that this product offers for the low price point. The Amazon-Fire is an inexpensive WiFi device we use for answering messages and is quickly shifted from person to person as well as moved from room to room. This tablet absolutely surprised me. The screen is awesome and the battery life is great. I love the Fire HD. Went back and bought the Fire 7\" for my wife that afternoon! I\\'ve had multiple Amazon Fire tablets. They are a great bargain. I love the ease of use and functionality. The only downfall is that it is really slow to charge. This was an awesome tablet purchased for my seven year old daughter for Christmas. Initially, I was looking to purchase the iPad mini but unfortunately they were sold out. This was my alternative and I am so glad I did. The price was perfect and the internet and app access have been great! She loves it! The only thing she misses is the FaceTime but it has not been a big deal at all! Gecksqd. Helpful in understanding different things . Upgrade from old Kindle Reader whose charger quit working android system easy to use I really like the value of this Fre. It is thin, light, and has all the features of those higher priced tablets. A good camera lens....and access to amazon deals make this well worth $69. Try it! Got this for my mom. Decent tablet not heavy and good pirce. She loves it. Great tablet - lag free when running apps... Good battery life. Only downside is lack of ability to screen mirror. Was available on older versions but no longer My father upgraded from the original Kindle Fire to this model, and he\\'s very happy with it. It doesn\\'t compete with more mainstream tablets, but he likes the Kindle\\'s system for downloading library books. Gave as Gift. the recipient powered down his IPad, and is giving it away. I bought this for my wife, this is her third Amazon Fire tablet. She mostly uses it for reading but she really likes the speed and the additional features on this one. She\\'s very happy with it Very bright display, speedy processor, and solid feel. Impressed. I bought this item as a Christmas gift for my granddaughter and she has loved every minute of it. It is intuitive, easy to use and she has it in her hands several times every day for everything from research for school to reading a book. Paw Paw hit a homer with this one! It was great product. the price which I got it was great. There\\'s different things my daughter can do,on it, plus I can read on it as well. It\\'s easy and intuitive. The only criticism is that it should be easier to go right into an application, instead of watching an advertisement, then having to figure out how to exit it Our first tablet. Purchased for my husband prior to a long train trip. Downloaded movies had Internet and was great for traveling. Works flawlessly. Good contender to my brother\\'s iPad. Much cheaper in price. Win for me. I purchased this for my mom for Christmas and she loves it! The amazon kindle is nice, portable and very easy to use. I bought this as a Christmas gift for my 8 year old. I was a big hit. I love the 8\" screen. The price was perfect for my budget. Great price for the internal memory size. If you are looking for a good tablet, this is it! I bought this for my 8 year old. I was a great buy. The price was affordable compared to other tablets on the market and e 8\" screen is perfect. Another great buy!!! I have an original Kindle Fire and am really enjoying my new updated version. Larger screen and very easy to navigate. I was given a fire when I was recuperating from spine surgery a few years ago. I used it for everything for quite some time. This one has a camera and plays all the latest files. I still have and use the old one as well. An excellent content delivery system. I got it with Best Buy customer appreciation money...what a deal! We purchased this as a gift. Researching and word of mouth led us to purchase this one. Very user friendly. The UI experience is great, especially for Prime members. The tablet is quick and responsive with plenty of memory to ha for any task. bought this for my elderly mother to play games, get email and pics via Instagram, etc. now she\\'s a geek! easy to use, even for a novice and very reasonably priced. Great buy, highly recommend this. Purchased this as a Christmas gift for my girlfriend. She absolutely loves it and uses it every day. She\\'s very picky about electronics and she loves her tablet so it must be good! It was a gift. The individual thoroughly enjoys it. the kindle is a great tool especially for the money. Fast processing, great screen clarity. Highly recommended This is my third Kindle (second Fire). I use it constantly primarily for reading electronic books. Currently have over 350 books in Kindle library. Like it best when traveling as I don\\'t have to carry a bunch of hardback books with me. Anywhere I go where I know there will be a waiting line (haircut, doctor\\'s or dentist\\'s office) I have it with me and use it productively to read.. The Fire HD is a nice tablet that functions well but doesn\\'t meet the shear horsepower and feel of an iPad....but, at about 1/4 the cost, it fits the bill pretty well. Great price. Easy start up easy to use.. large memory Great product I love that I can read all my books on here and search the internet! Being able to sign in and not have to do any setting up makes this device super user friendly! Love the tablets. Light, Good battery life, and fast performance. It was a fast deliver, the tablets is awsomo and it\\'s a great service My 15 year old is curious about adult material. But with this tablet you can control so much of the content he sees. You can even control how much he learns before watching videos and games. The Kindle/Amazon Fire HD Tablet is not a high priced item but it is everything I want from a tablet. Easy to use, easy to read and easy to pay for. A great tablet Best tablet hands down. Bigger screen and great new features. Has Alexis also. Lots of storage as well. I love this tablet. The size fits perfectly in one hand. The display is wonderful and the loaded apps have me reading again. It is the absolute best! Small and compact, surprisingly good image and sound. Having family members who lose cables all the time, this is a great deal. Reliable cable for the iphone at an affordable price. Plus the various cable colors allow me to assign colors for a person or charging station so we know when someone \"barrows\" a cable. I am satisfied with my products. I look weekly for a good deal. I look forward to more deals With a little tweaking you can install Playstore without rooting. It\\'s a great tablet, excellent color, fast, and battery lasts a very long time. Bought this table for my 4 and 9 year old for Christmas. They love them! It is a reliable easy to use tablet. Holds charge well and provides for my needs. I bought this for my girlfriend as a Christmas Present. She is a avid reader and has been using our ipad to read online library books. She asked me for a nook reader, but after seeing the fire....it was a no brainer to go in that direction. it is used everyday and she loves it. My grandson love this tablet alot of great games and learning activities. This smokes the Fire 7 which I picked up last year. Powerful and great screen for streaming...cannot go wrong for the price. Bought for my 7 yr old. Quality product at an affordable price. Bought on sale for $69.99. I would recommend this anytime as it\\'s a great product it\\'s For the money the Kindle Fire is the best tablet on the market. I wish I didn\\'t buy my I pad already I would have got one of these for myself. this does everything and more the older, more expensive Kindles. I\\'m not sure I need my ipad or laptop any more. My son loves it. There are a lot of kid friendly apps available. Purchased this for my 83 year old mother to primarily use as an e-reader. It seems as this may be easier for her to see than an actual book. She does not always find new technology easy to use, but seems to be doing ok with this tablet. She also is using it to play solitaire and possibly some other games. I left my 7 on airline flight and bought the 8 to replace love love the speed and the video on it. Glad I bought it is worth it!!!! the download speed has improved very much!! I was surprised on how easy it was to use. I bought it for my mother and she totally loves it, and I do too! Oh my, oh my, oh my! Amazon can do no wrong! This device is my precious! Purchased this for my wife during Christmas and got a great deal on it. Compared to the older version that she has this model is faster, brighter, and more convenient with Alexa. I would recommend this product looking for a tablet with lots of features packed in it. Purchased the device for my neice, she loves it, highly recommend Price/Quilty this thing is a no brainer. Awesome portal into the Amazon world. My wife uses this for playing on line games. She loves it I thought about purchasing a Samsung tablet also, however I do like to read as well. I saw several reviews that have a negative view because of the Amazon software and that it is not stock Android.However, I have installed the Play Store (you can find instructions online) and I am very happy with this tablet. I would definitely recommend it. Also I have had 10\" tablets before, and this one is just the right size. Bought this to update the old one we have and so far it\\'s been a good buy. Great screen resolution and easy to use. Battery life is really good. This was the perfect tablet for my wife for Christmas, she loves it. Easy to navigate and plenty of room for her favorites! Size, brightness, and convenience are good. The option to link with android products for messages is a little hard. I bought this for Christmas and my 10 year old loves it!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I need a tablet to begin exploring google and kindle fire was a great choice. Got this tablet for my mom who isn\\'t very tech savvy. She loves it. Can\\'t beat the price I am very impressed with this tablet. It is faster than some iPads I have used. I gave this as a gift and my Mother-in-law loves it. Thank you Hands down a great update to my first gen Kindle. Worthwhile! Cheaper than the paper white and has more abilities I bought this to replace an older model and am very happy with the product. Mostly used for reading but also for surfing the web, facebook, etc. Love it!! Got this as a gift for my mother and she\\'s satisfied This was a gift for my wife and she loves it!! It is much better than the old one Bought for my daughter instead of an I-pad. Works well, love the Amazon Underground App Store, but battery life doesn\\'t seem to last as long as older I-pads. Easy enough though for a child to use. Got it on sale and it\\'s good for what you pay for instead of paying a lot of money on an iPad. this electronic book reader is great, able to read ebooks, watch movies, play games. or browse the internet. it lets you hookup to any internet connection you want to use as long as its range Does a good job of performing basic functions and provides a good amount of entertainment. Good for watching movies or playing simple games or performing simple tasks. Looks good. Seems like it is well made and of good quality materials. Have not had any problems. Battery life is great for the price. Amazon sells a quality product. I am happy to get this product and i would also recommend this to my friends Last got Fire 7\" for my kids, with an Amazon Freetime subscription. These are very good for the price with two flaws: The screen is good and much better than other Android devices at 7\" but not great, and got the 8 Mb version with I would not recommend in hindsight. Because Android\\'s sub-par management on SD cards, got these this year. It has a much better screen, not only larger but with better resolution, adequate speakers for its price, it\\'s fast enough and overall more enjoyable to use. 16 Gb is the minimum I\\'d recommend, even with SD cards because some apps just work better with internal storage, and some apps even stored in SD will still use some amount of internal storage.It also has Alexa voice support.The main reason for these tablets in my case is the Freetime subscription that has unlimited access to thousands of age-appropriate books, hundreds (or thousand) of free apps and heavily curved web access per age presets. Amazon Fire OS has a decent support for multi-user and in particular kids accounts. My kids are 7 and 9. They spend a lot of time on games as expected but also read a good amount of books. As far as functionality it works well. I can surf the internet, match movies, check social media, and anything else a tablet is supposed to do. The app store has a good variety off apps. It does not have as many as the iTunes store, but there is plenty of variety. The reason I knock a star off is the constant ads. I know that this is an Amazon product, but the ads get a little annoying. I DON\\'T USE MUCH OF THE APPLICATIONS BUT IT WORKS FOR THINGS I NEED. If your looking for a great tablet without the high price this is the tablet for you... My wife loves her new Fire 8 tablet. It is easy to use and rubs quickly and smoothly,. Bright screen, lightweight, great price, I love it! It is a very nice tablet, but the 10 inch tablet seems faster and easier to enjoy for the price Really wanted a tablet that was near the nexus 7, but didn\\'t have too much bulk! I looked at the Nvidia Shield as well, and ended up settling on the Fire HD. Tremendous resolution, great battery life, and very easy to use. Highly recommend to anyone that wants a portable tablet for reading, watching videos/movies, and gaming. The first tablet I bought was good at first until it stops charging. I went to best buy to check it and they said that everything is okay. We tried it again at home and it was the same thing, it charged for a few min until probably 2% and will stop. I brought it back to the store and they replace it with a new one. So far I don\\'t have problem with it as well as the other 2 tablets that I bought together with the first tablet. It\\'s alright to browse the Internet and watch videos. Works great and has an excellent screen size. You cannot go wrong for the price unless you need to install google apps. Amazon blocks them although I have heard there are work arounds. Great product, good speed, nice resolution for the price. I have only had this Amazon Fire Hd8 since December 6, 2016 and it has already quit charging. It was easy to set up and use and the screen is big enough to play games on Its a nice tablet however it could be better but you get what you pay for My grandbabie love their kindles this is the 8th Kindle I buy for them I bought this for my son as a first tablet. I am impressed by the built-in parental app. It has a good level of control that I feel comfortable with. My son likes his Kindle. I think he will like it more when he gets used to having to get through the \"educational\" features before he can play. I admittedly need to explore the tablet more myself. That will enable me to customize the settings and the apps for him and myself. First experience with a tablet for my husband who likes it and uses it all the time. We like it. I bought this for my niece for a Christmas gift.she is 9 years old and she love it. My old Kindle was not working so good anymore so bought this one on a Black Friday Deal from Best Buy. Price was great. The only problem I had was that at times it did not seem to be charging well or fast. I took it back to Best Buy and they would have replaced it for me but then would have lost all progress in games I had played. The person at Tech Support suggested that I change the plug in \"brick\". He said that they have had problems with that. I can use the same plug that I use for my iphone and now it charges fine. Glad that it was an easy fix. Love the 8 inch HD tablet. Great colors on screen. Not cheaply built like some. This is the best tablet you can get for under $100. I have used or own many tablets including Ipad Pro/Mini, Samsung Galaxy Tab and Nexus. They are popular high-end tablets but easily cost over $300 or $400. I was very surprised by quality of this tablet and it gives you much more than what you pay. Battery performance is great- it easily lasts over 10 hours after charge. Speakers are solid with two drivers. Performance is decent although not as fast/responsive as high-end tablets. I was bit disappointed at its low contrast display. However for its price, I cannot complain too much. I purchased two of these tablets as a gift for Christmas. It has an exceptional HD screen which provides rich colors and makes it easy for those that like to read book, articles etc. One of the best tablets. Good for watching YouTube and reading as well. This Kindle is the right size for travel, yet large enough to read. Love all the features and price! Kindle Fire HD8 is great! Love the the size and the graphics. Easy to use and navigate. Perfect gift for mom! The battery life is great.Last on a bus trip to kept he quiet. I got this for my wife and she loves it. Great speed and display Gift for our son and he is really enjoying it. He can read as well as play games. I use this tablet as an e-reader and to listen to prime music at the same time. Great for this.Still leaning other features. I got this mainly to watch tv/movies. Battery life is best of all devices I have used to date. Enjoyed the Kindle 7 and now this better version as well. Purchased this on sale for my son. He and I use the tablet to watch movies, play games, read books, and browse the Internet. It\\'s great for the price we paid. If you\\'re a fan of Amazon, you automatically have apps for their services.The downside is you are not able to use google apps and the adds that appear from Amazon when you turn the device on. Really a nice item ..works wonderfully ..for the cost it\\'s a bargain Great product for the price! Works great and comes with ample storage. My kids really like this and if your buying a tablet for kids it\\'s worth it, but maybe not so great for adults. this tablet is excellent i use it on the couch inthe bedroom and in the car too i simplty love it Great resolution, easy to use. Amazon Prime gives you free movies, books, and games! This tablet was a Christmas gift for my dad. It has great resolution and is easy to use. With Amazon prime you get free movies, books, and games. I would highly recommend. We bought this tablet for our 4 year old to play games and watch Netflix. He loves it and at this price point, we\\'re not overly concerned if he damages it. We bought a nice foam case that keeps it well protected. We\\'re highly satisfied. Very good picture and it even takes pictures which is awwsome. You even get a free month of Amazon prime which came in very handy around Christmas Time My daughter loves this tablet! She plays multiple games and has taken video. Easy to use and the color is very vivid! Screen size good for older people. Great resolution and easy to use. Seems to work well. Screen quality is good. Like the size. I had been thinking about getting a reader for a while but did not know which one I wanted. As I looked at and tried several, I thought the Kindal Fire was the one I wanted. After discussing the features of the product with a salesperson, I decided.that it was the reader I wanted. It has turned out to be just what I wanted. Great value for the money. However, the operating system is a bit clunky. Constant notifications and messages to delete. Some can be turned off, other seem to just keep appearing. The reader app surprisingly is less than intuitive. I bought this for my son after he broke his iPad, and I am so glad I did!! It has unlimited games and books, which has made such a huge difference in his desire to read!! Love love this tablet!!! Bought this during black friday for $60. while I\\'m skeptical at first, it turns out to be a solid tablet for everyday use. Not to mentioned the great low price! I love the size of this tablet. I have an Ipad and think I prefer this size. It\\'s easy to carry and a great size for reading. Got it for Christmas and am loving it! I haven\\'t tried to take any pictures yet and I didn\\'t really purchase it for taking photos. I saw the reviews before purchasing and they were not good regarding photo quality. Again, that was not my purpose so am not too concerned at this time. The size and price makes this a best buy! I\\'m very pleased with my tablet I am thrilled with this purchase! Both affordable and high quality! I will try again for the 3rd time with my new Amazon Fire. It seems to have nice upgrades. This tablet works as well or better than my iPad. It is quicker and simpler to use with better speed and reaction. Pros:Great value for moneyEnough power to handle lot of Android gamesDecent battery lifeCons:Feels slow after using for a few weeksLow-resolution screen and camera. This is almost as good as my iPad mini. i love my apple iPad however this is a great backup. Tablet is great does everythimg as it should. Great entry level tablet This game seems to be another good addition to the Pokemon craze. My son got this for Christmas and has played it often since. He says that it\\'s \"awesome\", which is high praise indeed. So much better than my previous kindle, I\\'ve used my new kindle daily and I\\'m not much of a tech person. It is light weight and easy to navigate. The battery holds a good charge as well I was looking to purchase a tablet for my kids so they could work on homework. This is just what they need in terms of capability and size. It is a great tablet for the price. The 8 inch Fire is s great reader, 5 star. The only down side are limited add on applications. This tablet is so easy to set up and use. Very intuitive! Love love this device and all of my books can be transferred from my old version! Awesome The reader was easy to setup for a novice reader and email user. 2nd kindle bought as a gift. Easy to operate, can fit in my purse and eliminates having to carry around multiple traditional books. I gave this to my 6-year old for Christmas and it has been the perfect gift. Great price point (compared to an ipad) that can function for exactly what she needs. Screen is good . Lack of Google play kinda hurts but you will survive. The issue of back buttons or multifunction buttons is that sometime they don\\'t appear when you need them.. as they are part of the screen . So you have to kinda summons them which is a pain It\\'s a good tablet for the value. Downside is there\\'s no Google Play Store access. So you\\'re limited to apps in the Amazon app store. This is my first Android tablet. I have used numerous Apple iPad\\'s though.The only thing I have been dissatisfied with is that there isn\\'t an Instagram app available but that doesn\\'t have anything to do with Amazon or Kindle. Got one for myself and one for my son. Like the parental settings available. No more inappropriate youtube videos. Fast, great screen and appreciate the blue light setting especially at night. I purchased the HD 8 to use as a viewer for my Pearl RearVision camera, which requires dual band Wi-Fi and Blue tooth. I installed the programs & got everything up and working beautifully. However I was so impressed with its features, performance, and ease of use, that I\\'ve added a 128 gb MicroSD card so I can download Amazon videos for my grand kids to watch while we are on the road. The price was terrific as well, but comes with the cost of \"free\" ads when the you turn on the tablet. (FYI the tablet mounts magnetically to the vent holder and is removed when not in use.) If you are looking for an entry level tablet, this is it.The Kindle fire HD is perfect for kids! My daughter gets great use with this tablet. She loves to read so she gets best of both worlds. She can get her books and surf the web. Fsntastic buy Excellent value for my 3 yr old, everything you need plus HD and the wife can order off amazon prime, so happy wife and kid for the price cant beat it, 2nd one I have owned.... The Amazon HD 8 is by far the best budget tablet. If you just need a tablet to browse the web and watch videos this tablet is the way to go! That being said, it is fairly slow but who cares if you do not use the tablet for photo/video editing, gaming, picture taking, etc... I bought this for my mom. She loves the convince of reading her books on there This product is easy to use and take along with you I previously owned the Fire HD 7 and was excited about the HD 8. After getting the HD 8 and using it I started to notice how they were able to cut costs. The screen was not as crisp, the processor was slower and the speakers were not as loud as previous versions. Overall a good buy for the price but if you are expecting the quality that went into previous versions look elsewhere. Great for taking on trips. 16 GB, camera, computer The Amazon Fire HD8 is a great buy, very inexpensive but delivers great quality. Give a 4 rating and not 5 because there are advertisements on lock screen. Some may welcome the ads others not. Overall this tablet is great. Battery life is several days with very minimal usage. Battery lasts 7 to 12 hours with average usage including video. This Fire tablet is overall a good size, and has great features! We got this for our 9 yr old daughter and its perfect for her. There hasn\\'t been any issue with the games and educational apps she uses. I was in the middle of moving and didnt want to get a new labtop and found this Amazon Fire for a good price. Ive been very happy with it. If your looking for a cheap easy to use tablet look no further. This is a very good product my kids do homework on it Bought this for our 6 year old daughter and she uses it daily. She enjoys watching movies on it and playing learning games. So far it has been very durable and battery life has been great. Bought this for my husband at Christmas. He is VERY happy with it and It keeps him out of my hair. Bought one for our young son too. Now i can breathe. LOL. We\\'ve had no issues with them and has more than met our expectations. Well worth the money & a VERY good deal! Nice tablet, great price for the product makes a good gift for someone. My son wanted a tablet just for his books. We looked at e-readers and tablets, this was so much better and the price was perfect. I\\'m used to a n iPad so I wasnt impressed with the kindle. I found it hard to navigate the fire hd is great for reading kindle books . Its pretty slow for surfing the web. If your looking for a great kindle this is it. I would not recommend this for surfing the web. Bought this kindle for my dad for Christmas. He loves it. Best budget tablet out there. Hasn\\'t everything you need for someone who uses a tablet here and there. The only regret I have is that the price went down the week after I purchased it. It is much easier to use than a phone because of it\\'s screen size and it\\'s capabilities. This tablet is replacing an older model and the updates are wonderful. I can handle most media on this tablet and the resolution is great. I like the change of the camera to the back of the kindle instead of the front screen; now I can see what I\\'m aiming at! Easy to use and can\\'t beat the price. Love the kindle and the price was excellent. I would recommend it. Bought 2 of these tablets for my kids. They love them and easy to use. Bought this for my son and he absolutely loves it! I chose this one because of the price and size of screen to use as an ereader. It has not disappointed. Got this for the kids for Xmas...was the BEST gift. This is a great tablet for anyone easy to use!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Amazon Fire HD 8 Tablet: With a vivid 8 touch screen and access to Amazon Underground, this tablet makes it easy to watch movies, play games or catch up on your reading with personalized recommendations. Cloud storage offers simple access to your content from anywhere. Great entry level tablet/reader holds a lot and it\\'s expandable of 128 GB With the Amazon fire tablet you get everything you would expect in a high-end tablet for less than $100. That\\'s hard to beat! Love this tablet daughter uses it mainly and she really likes it good for reading and games as well as web surfing meets all needs ! Our 11 year old daughter received this for Christmas and she seems to love it so fay. Does just enough to keep her entertained and I love the fact that she can easily access her books when she wants. I loved this tablet. I did! BUT I did not love that I was being sold ads every time I powered up! I loathe even more that I would have had to pay $15 to discontinue that feature. Amazon if you want $105 dollars for the Kindle Fire, charge it! but don\\'t under price the device, and then flash ads at the the consumer at every opportunity. It is unbecoming of you! I returned this item pronto! This isn\\'t a high end tablet. Don\\'t buy it if your goal is to play the latest high octane tablet games. But for general use, for most people - web surfing, light games like Angry Birds and those match the fruit games, casting movies to a television - it\\'s an amazing value. The Amazon geared operating system isn\\'t a problem. It took a few minutes to get the Google world onto the tablet. - Google Play, Google Store, Google this and that. The 7\" version is an even better deal, but my mom needed this slightly larger screen. She loves it! Bought this for my father in law who is not tech savvy. The free \"May Day\" feature is the best part- I don\\'t get called for tech support all of the time. I\\'ve had this tablet for a few months now and i like it. The picture is excellent, the sound from the speakers is more than sufficient and the wifi is quick. bought this for my father, who never did much on computers and was not sure he would actually use this. He unwrapped it, asked for some games to be downloaded and hasn\\'t looked back! He has used the internet as well as the game apps and couldn\\'t be happier. Got this when they were on sale last year and love it!I use it primarily to read and get emails with some surfing. It has worked flawlessly for these applications. Nice tab and worth for its money..got this from best buy during thanks giving and gifted to my friend... Hard to use, No way to delete things from screen. Need better manual. most books are impossible if they are reference books. Bought for our son so he wouldn\\'t have to carry books back from his deployment Sweet tablet yo, does good work for my grandma and super easy I bought this tablet on Black Friday, when it was on special for my little girl. I wasn\\'t expecting much from the tablet... boy was I surprised by its capabilities! Love the tablet! Bought for my 9 years Granddaughter, she loves it. I love my new Kindle. Use it everyday. It is easy to use and understand I chose this a tablet. Very easy to use and navigate. My 6 and 4 year old grandsons can use them with ease. Some apps are limited as you do not have Google Play, but there is plenty of games and learning games available. Got this for my 10 year old grandson. He really likes it a lot. This is good for kids to learn responsibility using tablets. This was an item I bought for black Friday because the price was really low. I love it. It gets the job done, great travel item. $49.99, is exactly how much it\\'s worth. The sound is low, but again for a good inexpensive, travel tablet, this is a Best Buy:) Long battery life, good screen, reasonably fast.gaming. Got it for my 9 year old son for his Common robot, he loves it, it\\'s very easy to use and for the price well worth it I bought 2 one for each one of my daughters and they both like them. Got this kindle as a Christmas present for my mother and she absolutely loved it. She enjoys reading at night but hates how dim the lights are when she reads a book. This was a perfect compromise! This is a very good tablet for the price, especially for Amazon Prime members. The display is very sharp and so far the battery life is excellent! Great starter tablet without the big cost. Does everything I need. Got this for my wife for Christmas, wasn\\'t sure she would use it. Turned out to be a great gift. Perfect for email, facebook with the Kids, get\\'s her bookclub book delivered instantly from Amazon. And good battery life with a sharp picture. I bought 2 of these. I didn\\'t want to pay the price for an iPad since they were a gift for my pre-teens. Very satisfied with my purchase and the kids were able to get their gaming apps. Con: they take a while to charge, that\\'s why I\\'m giving it 4 stars. The Amazon Fire is great for our 6 year old to play some games. Brought it as a gift for my wife and she loves it! I was initially excited to get the Kindle. I am extremely disappointed with all the ads. Even more disappointed to find out that I could pay Amazon more money to remove the ads. It\\'s frustrating that Best Buy and more specifically Amazon, don\\'t let the consumer know on the box or in store advertising that what you\\'re buying is a mini advertising billboard. Why couldn\\'t there be an upfront statement on the box or in the store stating that the \"low price\" is subsidized by all the ads on the device? Would this have changed my purchase? Absolutely!!!! I would have spent a couple bucks more and probably got a Samsung tablet. Kindle Fire HD8 is an upgrade for me from Kindle Fire 7. It has many more features and is very easy to navigate. Can\\'t beat the quality and performance of this tablet for $60. I bought it to be my main link with my Amazon Prime. But used it last week instead to download Direct TV app so I could use it to watch the FBS championship game. It worked great but it couldn\\'t help my bama team win. Just what my Niece wanted for Christmas! She is enjoying every minutes use ! Bought for my Grandson for Christmas. He loves it. Glad I went with the 16GB,Thanks to the advice of BEST Buy employee. I got this for reading books, I still like ipad better though. Purchased this for our 8yo--she loves it! Had to return the 1st one after just.a few days as the screen would go black after typing in password--periodically. However, Best Buy traded it out for a new one! BOUGHT THIS FOR MY FATHER AS HE HAD MY OLD KINDLE EASY FOR HIM TO USE This is my 4th Kindle - I use it as a tablet when I travel Overall this is a great product. It sometimes freezes with some of the games but other apps work great. Alexa is a great addition. So many apps to look at hard to put down when everythig can be reached at your figertips Great tablet, sturdy, excellent screen quality. Amazon has done a fantastic job of making their tablets user friendly. Excellent for reading books or playing games. Would highly recommend. The screen is great on the Fire HD 8. This tablet was given to a child and she loves the tablet. The only thing I don\\'t like about the whole Amazon experience is the advertisement. Other than that, the tablet is nice. The headphone jack restarts the tablet when you plug the headphone cord into it. That is why I am giving the product only 2 stars. Otherwise, the screen is great. Simple and objective this tablet is an excellent choice for adults and children. This is an intermediate size tablet that works very well for its designed purpose. The price was good and it has plenty of acc. Love this one.It is my third kindle.My last one was a bit larger but it was a bit heavy.Love this one for reading or playing games.I can check my email and shop on line as well as take and store photos.I can also listen to music. Good tablet. A lot of tablet for the money. Great for kids Amazon continues to offer quality products with the Amazon fire HD 8 for a reasonable price. Good price, easy to work and the Grandkids loved . Wanted something small and this was perfect size . They just keep getting better. This is great for the beginner or pro I only use the kindle fire tablet for entertainment; music, games and eBooks. It\\'s a great basic tablet at a low price. The SD card I added allows me to save lots music and books. The tablet is rather slow in charging but once fully charged it holds up well. Upgraded from 1st generation Fire tablet. Decided to go with 16GB tablet and there were none in store so I had to order for free delivery to store. Arrived on day promised. Was easy to sync new tablet with older tablet. Very nice picture and video. Great value. Wife loves it so makes my life better what else do you need to know past that. The screen size is good and the HD pictures are clear. I also like the camera photos. They are better than my cell phone camera. The size of the pictures are great. I would recommend this Fire HD for the ease of use. The built quality is great taking into considerarions its price. The tablet is pretty fast and responsive. However, Amazon\\'s operating system is horrible. I miss a lot of apps that I use in my Apple devices, and some others that just don\\'t work as good such as Mint and Netflix (don\\'t have download capability). Also it won\\'t work with my Chromecast devices... I bought this for my wife and she absolutely loves this device . I have an older kindle and wanted more space. This works very well The amazon fire hd8 is awesome! Easy to navigate, color is beautiful A great tablet for not a lot of money. Does what the more expensive tablets does for less. Got it last black Friday. Was looking for a cheap decent tab. Could\\'ve been better if there was a mirroring capability. Was looking at some more expensive Android tablets to replace a 3-year old device and saw this one on sale. Despite the relatively much lower price, I was originally very worried that the Amazon app ecosystem was going to be sorely lacking compared to the full Google Play catalog. But it turns out that while it is missing some important apps (not just games but productivity apps too), the more than adequate specs (good enough screen, 1.5 GB of RAM, decent processor) are enough for 95% of what I need from a tablet. And if you can get it on sale, you can\\'t go wrong. Lastly, if you\\'re deciding between the 7\" and this 8\" Fire, splurge a little bit and get this one instead. Amazon Fire HD8 is great for browsing and reading. GPS system not that great though. I was not told I had to belong to Amazon. Could not get it to work with my Router. I had been wanting this Tablet for some time and finally decided to purchase it. I am heart sick to have to return it. At one time working with the a general Manager by the name of Brenda on my problems, she was highly disrespectful , embarrassing to me I front of other customers and very rude. Representing Best Buy to the people who actually pay her salary and taking all into account, I would fire her in a heart beat. I understand from other employees she is like this quite often. If you can\\'t fire her maybe taking her off the floor where she has to deal with the public and putting her behind the scenes would benefit Best Buy more than you know. 01-16-2017. Thank you. This is the best thing for reading specially on the go. Now I want one. My older son wants one to. Keep of the good work. It\\'s good budget tablet for someone who wants to use light apps, video streaming, and internet.1.5gb ram is enough for most apps.16g memory and sd card slot gives enough space. This is my second amazon fire purchase. I wanted one for home and one to keep with me for traveling and work. It\\'s was to negotiate and fits all my basic daily needs. Bought this tablet cause it was super cheap during December. It\\'s a good tablet for someone who doesn\\'t need a powerhouse This is a good tablet for basic use. I ened up returning it and going with an iPad which met my needs more. This tablet would be good for someone with limited computer knowledge/use. Purchased this as a Christmas gift for an adopted family. The teenager absolutely loved it! Awesome tablet! Super quick, great picture, and overall great quality This was bought as a replacement for my wife\\'s previous kindle. She is loving the larger screen and the fact that it has a camera. Nice tablet, gives different choices for readers. Easy to use. Bought the tablet on Black Friday to replace a 4 year old Nexus 7. Liked it so much that I purchased another a week later at full price. Bright clear screen, good battery life, expandable memory, fast and easy to use. No complaints. Bought it for myself. It is everything its advertised to be. Works great; especially if you are a Amazon Prime member. This product met my needs perfectly. It was easy to set up and portable to use anywhere. I bought this tablet during black friday for 60 dollars and it is well worth the price. Definitely an upgrade from the first gen tablet. This watch is not only very useful, it\\'s very cute and comfortable. I love the fitness aspects-it motivates me to be more active. I also enjoy the \"smartwatch\" abilities. I can read my text messages without anyone knowing it! Also, the battery last a few days at the very least. Best Buy has a good price structure for the Kindle Staff members were very helpful Had a paperwhite for years...The fire is my go to for news, new shows, and reading. Good book prices, credible news. Loving it. Paying $49 for a decent screen size to support portable surfing and email on wifi is a great deal. Not sure I\\'m a fan of Silk, but it works well enough. The Amazon Fire HD is easy to use. The 8\" tablet is just the right size. Sharp screen that\\'s not too big or small. Takes some getting used to if you normally use an IPhone. Be prepared for ads, which must be the reason they can sell it at such a low price. Slim profile, just heavy enough to feel substantial and high quality. Hard to find cases at physical stores. My friend is enjoying getting acquainted with her first ever electronic device. It is just what she needed to get into the digital age. She is an older woman and is excited about all she can do on her Kindlefire. I was not sure what to expect from this little tablet at such a low price but I am impressed! The 8 inch version is a good size and a lot easier to carry around than my heavier 10 inch tablet. I read negative reviews about the video quality but I have not had any issues and use it to watch Netflix regularly with very clear and uninterrupted quality. The amazon App Store is definitely limited but with an android based system, it is very easy to install the google play store without having to root your device and voiding the warranty. This was a gift for my wife and she has truly enjoyed it. The different lighting for reading so helpful. Very user friendly. For the price best deal out there. Bought it for my wife who reads a lot of books. She loves it!! This is a very solid device for under $100. The screen quality is great, and performance is hard to beat for most typical use. I needed more power to run some very intense apps, like Litchi for controlling a DJI Mavic. So if you are looking for a Powerhouse you should look for something with a bit more processor and atleast 3Gb Ram. Amazon is great tablet and the price is excellent great Have a 7\", wanted a bigger screen. This is perfect and price was great. User friendly and overall great product. Camera quality is not the greatest but this is not intended to be used as a camera so I can\\'t complain. Love this tablet easy to use and extremely affordable If you\\'re main purpose is shows, books, light web browsing/social media, and light gaming -- this is the perfect tablet. Very friendly price. Nice construction. Bought as a reading tool for my daughter. She enjoys it and also the fact that she can download apps. Great tool for school and fun Bought for husband to replace his old one. Uses it all the time and would recommend. daughter loves it uses it every day likes everything about it. My youngest daughter is very pleased with this tablet. Easy to use. Perfect for using for my clinicals in nursing school Great tablet for the price, it was a Christmas present and so far so good! Easy to use and the HD is awesome. The simplicity as well as the easy to follow directions to set it up is great. It does everything I want it to do. Great products as usual and great customer service Very functional for a tablet and e-reader. This was a purchase for my stepmom who broke her previous Kindle. She likes it because the screen is big, ease of use, and you can access the internet. The kids side is good too for the kids but some of the apps like YouTube and YouTube Kids will not play on this because it\\'s an Amazon operating system. Overall I would recommend this to people who like the regular e-readers and want a tablet. It helps if your an amazon prime member . You can download a lot more things to do on the tablet This was purchased as a gift for an avid reader and as a streaming media device. I looked at the bigger kindle but this one is the right compromise between size and portability for the planned uses. A great alternative to the more expensive tablets. Battery lasts for quite a while. Love love love my kindle fire. Had the original and then bought and iPad then bought this kindle and I am wondering why I even bought the iPad. Will not switch again. I will stick with my kindle. The fire runs well and was easy to set up. The pop up adds are a bit annoying but the tablet works well. Happy with the purcase. Gift for my mother in law. ok i did like the product very much thank you for ok I recommend this tablet !!! I like it a lot , perfect size and perfect price Great for reading books. Does everything an iPad or tablet does. Bought for Xmass for my wife. She is not electronic competent, but found is easy to use. Tends to flip out of my screen to something else. Each screen change = at least one pop up ad. Otherwise, it\\'s been reliable so far. It is a lot cheaper than other tablets with all the functions I need. This is a excellent tablet for browsing the internet and reading ebooks and for the price you can\\'t beat it.. My ND would way rather have a fire any day than an ipad! Loved the product. First I was disappointed that I could not download Google Store apps but a Quick Google Search fixed that Issue and now I can download any Google Store Apps. The Battery Life is amazing as I was able to Watch around 4 Full Movies on a Single Charge. Performance is great as Games like Marvel Champions Modern Strike Online had no issues. Able to add an SD Card is just perfect as I dont have to worry about Storage for downloading Movies or Apps. Speakers are better then my Samsung Galaxy S7. For the Price point of this Tablet there is not a single thing to Complain. If I have to Brightness of the Screen can be better. the amount i paid for the tablet is worth it on sale. Gifted this to my Mom primarily for reading books. Able to check out e-books from our local library. Works great. She also uses this for Skype, e-mails and Facebook. Her grand kids also use it - downloaded few games and play. Bought this during Black Friday sale and was an even better deal. It is a good tablet. My grandson loves it . He was very happy with it . This tablet works well for surfing the internet and playing music. My husband and I have totally enjoyed owning these Amazon Fire tablets. They are so much easier on the eyes than our iphones! My 8-year-old grandson is able to access all the games he\\'s used to, but also many new games and videos. He finds something new to do almost every time he turns it on. Great improvement over the old kindle fire. Better size than the hd7. Not to big and not too small. Fast processing spead. My wife loves it. Great picture quality and easy to use should have bought 2 at the sale price, fast, decent graphics great for reading ebooks best of fits in wife\\'s purse If you are looking for an inexpensive tablet just for basic web surfing/shopping/etc., I don\\'t know that you can get a better deal. However, that is about all you can do. We found out the hard way that the Fire (which we bought to replace a misplaced iPad, so maybe we were just spoiled) is pretty limited in terms of the Apps you can download. Forget about any Google based Apps and many of the standard apps that are generally available in the Android or Apple market place. I love Amazon itself and don\\'t have any major issues with the product I got for the price I paid, I just won\\'t be going the cheap route in the future. Hindsight being 20/20, I should have spent the money to just get a new iPad since that is what we were used to. Got this for my 10 year old son. Great for reading books and playing games. Can\\'t beat the price. Bought for my wife.. she loves it.. took some getting use to though but she is doing well with it I have a couple of iPads and decided to get this for general browsing, movie watching etc. Very pleased with the overall package. An added bonus is the very nice Amazon integration. Bought as a gift for my mother. Instead of her feeling locked at the computer she can now access the web from anywhere in the house. This is just the perfect item for what we needed. It is compact and can go anywhere with you. She says this was the best gift she ever received. My kids got this to replace their Ipads and haven\\'t missed a beat. Love the new Fire - great for books, games, and getting online! Easy to use features and perfect size screen to take on the go! Bought this for my aunt for Christmas. She had wanted a book reader. But then she decided she wanted something she could \"play games on.\" She\\'s very happy with it! Never owned a tablet before, but am loving it so far. great tablet, simple to use, just love it.compatible with other amazon products. I bought this for my Mother because her Nook wasn\\'t working any more. Although it took her a little while to adjust to the new device, she really enjoys it! I wanted a tablet that was a decent screen size, that could play games, that could stream movies (Netflix, Prime), that could check e-mails, that could Skype, etc. all while remaining affordable (under $100). I have yet to see a tablet in this price range that can do all these things effortlessly, while remaining this affordable. This tablet has handled whatever I throw at it, and with no hiccups. I had the cheaper $50 Fire tablet prior to this one, and that thing was slow to process the most basic tasks. If you\\'re looking for an affordable tablet that can do what a more expensive tablet can do, then pick this one up. Purchased as a replacement for an older kindle and the fire HD did not disappoint. The intended recipient was thrilled that a camera came with it. Well worth the money. 4th amazon product I own it is a great budget tablet. Bought for the daughter for Christmas and seems to work great Bought this for my wife for Christmas (a perfect gift, if I do say so myself), and seeing the joy that it brings her on a near daily basis makes me want one for myself. Alas, it will be another six years in the sequin mines outside Nashville until I can save enough to get another one. But someday... I purchased this during the black friday sale. I\\'m happy with the overall product with the exception of two things.1.) the auto brightness control is not good enough for me, its either too bright or too dark. I can\\'t figure out if I\\'m having issue with the colors or something else.2.) the 2nd issue is not with the tablet itself but after using this for a while i\\'ve realized using 8\" tablets for watching movies is not a good experience. For the price this tablet is an absolute steal! I\\'ve never had an iPad to compare it to but that\\'s only because I\\'ve never wanted to spend hundreds of dollars for a tablet. Recently upgraded from the 7inch kindle and i must say huge improvements. all i can say is that if they can speed up the processor by next year with more ram they might compete with the ipad! The tablet was a good gift for Christmas. I bought it on black Friday for a cheap price For my 3-year-old, it serves it purpose and very cost effective. I put a memory card in this and put the Play Store on it (Google it). I use it as a mini office with a Bluetooth keyboard. I love it. This 8\" tablet is much better than the older 7\" tablet. It is faster and have a camera. Great improvement over the older version. This is an awesome tablet, fast, great HD display and has all the apps I need for personal entertainment. If you look for a great tablet for entertainment, surfing the net, or reading your e-mail, this is the best you can have. I also purchased a 128 GB SanDisk Ultra Plus memory card. I strongly recommend it, not for work but it’s great for entertainment. Great size. Works with all apps. No issues yet. Would buy more. bought this for my son(12), and he loves it. Constantly on it. Got a great price during the holidays. Completely satisfied. This Amazon Fire is perfect for what I need - nice screen and memory size, really nice apps preinstalled and it\\'s just ready to use! The Black Friday price was beyond wonderful!!!!! Gifts for 4 yr old grandsons very easy for them to maneuver around.. great charge life. We have to force.them to take breaks. I bought this tablet for myself for Christmas! I\\'ve enjoyed the ease of use and the price I paid was great. In fact, I purchased another for my son for Christmas. This is the perfect tablet for basic use or if upgrading from the kids edition of the Amazon Fire. Much less expensive than an iPad and more durable if you have a tween who isn\\'t always careful with their tech. This was the first time I had a tablet. It is so much fun to play games on! Prefer no amps on unit and just allow buyer to place the amps they want or will ever use. Had to chose between Fire 10 and Fire 8. For the money, you can\\'t go wrong with the Fire 8. Screen is good for \" older eyes\". I have been holding off buying one of these for years, but on black friday the price was an astonishing $49. The amount of tablet you get for that amount of money is unrivaled. It is a great investment if you enjoy books or media. Great for kids, my kids haven\\'t stopped playing with it This is perfect for kids. The parental controls make me feel secure in letting my child use the tablet safely. I would recommend this to other grandparents for their grandkids this works great if you use amazon a lot and watch movies from amazon Great product for surfing the internet or reading books! I am familiarizing my self with no conclusion to say something about it now. I was expecting an Android device and discovered it was an \"Android like\" device. My fault for not reading up on his device before hand. I returned the Amazon Fire and bought a Samsung Tab E.I probably would recommend this tablet if you wanted a device for reading. Bought this as a gift for my aunt and she loves it. Easy to get connected and set up. She is totally non-techny and was able to do it herself. Great buy! I was surprised by the quality of the screen, and it is no slouch either. I love this Kindle and bought it for the upgrades to replace my original kindle fire. I would give it an excellent rating if the camera were better but the pictures come out grainy and not very clear. Great for watching shows and videos and these are very clear.. Love playing games on it and of course reading the latest books. Was looking for an inexpensive tablet for our child. Got this while on sale and ordered a screen protector and child case. Has worked well. Can set daily limits to prevent them from using to much. Would buy again. If adding more than one child to the account, the screen will not rotate properly for the second, third, or fourth child. Geek squad could not fix this problem, seems to be a manufacturer\\'s issue. Also, there are too many adds. I returned this product. I brought Fire HD8 for my Daughter, She have been used it since Christmas. Bought it on sale for Christmas gift and we\\'ll worth the money. Does everything needed with good functionality. Easy to use for those not too tech savvy. Bought this as a gift - they seemed to like it. The price was nice and so was the size of it. This tablet is more often used than my ipad, the free games from amazon underground is cool with amazon prime and if you like to read it has plenty of book options and integrations with digital purchases! This is a great device. I needed something small to read books on. This device is exactly what I was looking for. Purchase this tablet during the Christmas holidays on sale. Got as a gift for my job\\'s Christmas gift party. The person who got it was very happy with it. I am familiar with the tablet because I bought one for my wife when they first came out for her to use to read her books. Good tablet for book reading and audio books, many good apps to chose from. Very good for picking up e-mail when traveling. I\\'m still finding more ways to use it. Only had it about a month. My nephew likes the \\'large\\' size of the Fire tablet as it\\'s significantly larger than his phone. This is a great little tablet especially for the price. The new tablet is great ！ nice upgrades！Love how easy it is to use. Easy to get apps, shop and browse the web. Nice deals on the product with saving and good customet experience. I bought the Kindle Fire HD as a Christmas gift for my mom. She has never had a computer or Kindle. She loves it. Best gift I gave her. She plays a lot of games on it. That keeps her mind working. Love the size of screen. Purchased for my nephew for Christmas. He loved it and really enjoy it for playing games and reading books. Purchased this for my nephew. He loved it and can\\'t stop playing with it. I bought this as a light-weight alternative to an iPad for collecting and enjoying Kindle and Amazon Video products. When combined with the dedicated Fire cover, it\\'s low price along with a very readable screen and the option for a Micro SD card make it an excellent choice for travel and time spent in waiting-rooms, etc., allowing lots of memory space for ones library as well as flexibility regarding how it is held or positioned. My grandson broke his Amazon fire table one day after warranty expired. He was disappointed. So I bought him an 8 version . He had a big smile. This serves every function I need in a tablet. Price is right. It\\'s a handy little tool to have for reading e-Books. Bought this as a gift but was wrong item wanted so wasn\\'t used Easy to use, fast, sleek and battery holds good charge , happy with it Very easy to use and navigate. Perfect size to carry in my purse and still a good sized screen to watch movies. This product is very user friendly and it is very lightweight this was great buy & can do it all.fair price & great games Most of the time I use the tablet for the Web, reading and email, but when I want to work on a Word doc, pdf, budget and a lot more, I can do it well on the tablet without pulling out my laptop. The screen isn\\'t as sharp as the S2 models but is nice enough and it does not lack anything else. This was bought primarily for photos. I added the 128 card. Putting in the 128 card might have been a little tricky but the sales rep did it for me. My wildlife photos look brilliant on the tablet. I\\'d recommend making a Geek Squad appt for about an hour after you plan to buy the tablet. That way you learn how to use it before leaving the store. Also I got one that had been returned but all the parts still had the plastic wrap on them. That made it $100 less and hence the \"great deal\" in the title. It may pay to ask about a return. I plan to take some of the free classes offered. It was well worth the Black Friday price! The screen is so clear, it is easy to handle especially for people with not so big hands, easy and fast when navigating. I liked the volume buttons on the side of my old 7\" Fire better than on top like this new 8\". That\\'s the only reason I didn\\'t give it a 5 star rating. i just adore my fire 8...the features, size of screen, easy log in and graphics This is an awesome tablet. it is fast with great pictures! Price was right, great tablet for playing games and reading I got this tablet for Black Friday at a decent price. It\\'s 8 inches, you can add more space with a micro sd and very easy to use. Tablet works great. Nice big size good battery power. No problems using it. I am still learning all the different things I can do with the Kindle Fire. So far I like it. Perfect product for senior citizen who just wants to do a little internet shopping and receive and send emails. Nice size screen and easy to use. Great gift for a lot less investment than an ipad or laptop. Great buy for the money, no complaints. Highly recommended. I bought this as a gift and the recipient loves the processing speed and the fact that it has 2 cameras on the device. I am very happy with the kindle fire hd 8. it is very easy to use. I bought this for my mother for Christmas. She is not the most technological advanced individual. She really wanted a tablet and this one works great and is super easy to use. I went to program it for her and she insisted on doing it herself. She was able to no problem! Easy to use tablet. Price is pretty good. My mom loves it. Bought this tablet for a relative for Christmas who wanted access to audiobooks. My only issue is that the tablet needs a wifi connection in order for the audio to work with certain apps. Not a problem if you have constant access to wifi but my relative does not. Nice tablet otherwise. This device completely meets my needs for reading and accessibility. Works good, has very nice screen brightness and resolution I bought this tablet for my 9 year old. Easy to use and awesome graphics. Easy for adults to manage apps and parental controls. When my husband and I bought our Kindle Fire 8, we went to Best Buy and asked questions as best we could. There are programs we apparently need to put create and edit documents and spreadsheets!! We did ask if it had those features and was told yes but I think we need to have a special app. Why isn\\'t there a manual or step by step guide on getting the most use out of Kindle Fire 8. Can I get it online? Kindle Fire 8 fun to use but needs more info for customers. Can we go to a class at Best Buy? Thanks for any help. Great tablet for the price point....especially if you are big Amazon user.Expandable memory is a great feature. The kids more expensive tablets died twice. Repair was more than the Fire brand new. I would buy another one for the priceGood product My teenager loves to read and we purchased it for her. Great purchase! Would give 5 stars but THE ADDS!!!!!! Just as functional as my iPad Replaced Kobo EReader with this tablet, very satisfied with performance and price. Upgraded from a standard kindle to a kindle fire. Lots more features and about the same price.. I would definitely recommend this for anyone who wants a tablet but doesn\\'t want to pay a lot of money.. This was a great Christmas gift for my kid. This allows them to store their favorite books and play some educational games. Its nice to also have an optional MicroSD card for extra storage. works great for reading or playing games it connects to the web fast and responds very well I got this on black Friday for my mother and so far she enjoys it. It was to replace her iPad mini 1 that they have basically designed to become in operable within 2 years. She can add storage to the Kindle, the picture is fire, and she can read a plethora of books that suit her fancy. It\\'s nice size and responsive. Perfect for face timing with family. Perfect for travel. Convenient and way to use. First tablet for me. Very happy. Bought two tablets for the kiddos. Overall, price was great and works well. Only issue is download speed. Tends to take a while to download apps and other stuff. I love this! I use it daily! And I love the fact that I can add a ad card for more memory! Love it and would recommend it for the young as the old Kids got the kindle fire for Christmas, pretty happy with it. Purchased on black Friday deal for $59.99. Good buy! Not iPad quality but a fraction of the price and nice for watching prime videos and normal apps. Would purchase at standard price also as a fun extra tablet. Bought this tablet for my wife and she likes it. She plays a few games, checks her email, and goes on Facebook. High end users would not be satisfied with this tablet but overall an excellent value. Unable to download the Instagram app. which stinks I had an Apple Mini Ipad that was an older version and ran very slow due to older version OS I was told. I bought the Fire to replace it since I mostly use it for gaming through my WIFI. It was way cheaper and does everything I wanted and is very fast. No issues waiting for uploads. It has all the other features as well like weather, camera , and I have started to use Alexa and that is great. Nice size screen. Very fast easy to use nice size nice screen I bought this for my husband who is in a nursing home to be able to listen to music.. He loves it... And uses it every day for music and other things too. I love my old kindle, but after a few years and drops the power button doesn\\'t like to work a lot of the time. So took advantage Black Friday deal to replace the one that is going out. Basically, the tab\\'s features are good. There are huge Amazon collections. Kids can be allowed to use it without parents monitoring as parents control feature is good. Several useful Amazon products are offered free of charge. I hope that It is worth for the money value. nice tabket for the money with many nice features and durable I love the kindal because i am a reader. i able to check out books from library through overdrive but if i get an alert about world event i simply go to ond of the news app\\'s and get the latest headline. Great price. Love this tablet! Super bright colors! Great for gamers! Can\\'t bet this tablet for any price! I love reading my books on this, and the Alexa flash briefings each morning before I go to work at top notch The kindle fire hd is a wonderful tool as well as a device for entertainment. The beauty of the kindle fire is the price. I look forward to buying updated devices. My son enjoys it no complaints works great long battery life holds a charge better than any tablet i have ever had nice size, very clear but randomly shuts off. cant remove unwanted apps from the home screen. if you watch video..it buffers alot and laggs. love it, can do alot of stuff on it, would recommend fire hd8 to everyone This is the 3rd Kindle Fire that I have purchased. This one is much faster and more user friendly. We just bought our 2 grand daughters and 2 grandsons a Kindle Fire with the youngest 8 yrs old. He has it mastered already. Great tablet for a good price. Being used to an Ipad this is difficult to adust to but does the job just fine for a low price - good size to carry around without weighing down your purse. Would buy again This is an awesome product love the flexibility it has with not only book reading but other apps as well. Received this tablet as present for young grandson. While I am not an Amazon tablet fan (don\\'t like hybrid operating system), this device meets all the requirements I had hoped for: ease of use, optional micro SD capacity, and plenty of internal memory. No technology is ever like a real book you can smell, but this little notebook in nice. It does so many things well. This is my second kindle. Love size of screen and it is super light. Great camera. We originally owned an original kindle but it was slow app store was not the best and overall interface was to be desired. In fact eventually the device crashed and couldn\\'t be recovered with limited use. Deeply debated about getting another and actually bought a Samsung tablet, but it was too small. This was such a good deal it was hard to ignore and have been very happy to give another try. This device is a great size and much better interface. Would buy again and will consider in the future for the kids. My daughter loved it nd I love that she leaves my phone alone now. We ordered one for each of our 2 boys (ages 7 and 5) as Christmas gifts. They love them. Setup took a bit of time to get the Amazon store and parental controls, but well worth the time once its was all set up. We set it all up before wrapping them so the kids could enjoy them right away. It\\'s their favorite gift this year. Easy to use and great quality. All 3 of my kids have a Kindle Fire I bought this e reader for myself and I love it. The price was great and the product is nice. I got this for myself on black Friday. I have had 2 Kindles before but never the Fire. Love it! I love the fact that is very practical and I didn\\'t have to spend a lot of money. Well my kids love them. So that\\'s great for me. The only bad thing I can say is i can\\'t figure out how to make it so they can download free games and not ones that cost money. Got this kindle on black Friday for a great price. It is a good performer at a great price. I use it as a nice versatile tablet, not just for kindle bok reading. Wow this tablet for the price of 40$ at the time what a value. Works very well, easy to use, great for beginners. I\\'m not very good with electronics, so I was worried about learning how to use my Kindle Fire. I had no problems at all with navigation of this device. I feel it\\'s also fast I was expecting it to be sluggish. I think this is great for the beginner and is a great bargain. This imy 3rd kindle device.I chose it becazuse it haf more memory/stoeage This is a great tablet plus you can\\'t beat this price. I got this tablet on Black Friday. It was a great price, and being a Prime member, it has become my favorite entertainment venue on the go. The screen\\'s not as sharp as an iPad or Samsung tablet, but for the price I got it for and its entertainment value, it can\\'t be beat. I bought my fire tablet during the Christmas sale season for a great price to replace my aging iPad. I am really impressed with the speed of downloads and the quality of the video. I added an inexpensive SD card to download videos and shows. It is great for travel. The fire hd 8 is a nice improvement over the 7\" model. First, the extra ram makes browsing noticeably smoother and the screen is crystal clear. It is not on the same level as apple ipad or samsung galaxy, but still a huge improvement over previous kindle tablets. I bought the Amazon Fire HD 8 for my husband for Christmas. He\\'s never too excited about gifts but he is using this tablet every day and even though he won\\'t admit it, he absolutely loves it. Would definitely buy again, especially during Black Friday specials. Easy to use, size is just right. Easy for my wife to travel with and carry in her purse. As a low priced 8\" tablet, it has a good display, good speed, and reasonable battery life.I am a bit peeved by the rather intrusive adds that Amazon pushes onto it.I am also unhappy that I cannot load all the apps I am used to using on my Android phone. Overall, I wish I had spent more for a real Android device rather than having this with the Amazon limited version of Android. This tablet was a gift to my daughter because she\\'s an avid reader and anime watcher. She has been nothing but excited since she opened it and there have been zero complaints. My kindle fire HD8 is quite an upgrade to my old Kindle. Camera is a terrific addition and the screen is so much better. Got an unbelievable deal!! The best part is having a library of books at my fingertips!! Easy and simple to set up and great when I\\'m traveling!! I bought this for my daughter and she loves it! Works great for YouTube, Netflix and adding a few games. Easy to learn how to use and no \"accidental\" purchases can be made if you use the option to switch user accounts. My boys love their new tablets due to the cool features, books, apps and games. I love the parental controls, processor speed, battery life and light weight. Combined with a great discount at Best Buy and you get a win, win, WIN! I was using this for a while it was 10X faster then my kindle 5th generation yes 1gb of ram but the App Store made from Amazon is not the best so I downloaded the google play store to get the apps I mostly used I only use my kindle fire had 8 for books and reading or watching YouTube or the web I\\'m giving the rating 4 stars If you are using Amazon Prime, you definitely like this table as it can stream the video, audio, reading book... easy to carry with you I\\'ve had kindles since they first came out love it Perfect for my elderly mom to play games and use for reading It is a good tablet, but is a little slow downloading apps Great for what it is. The product is solid. Got it as a gift for family. Bought as a gift for my Mom. She\\'s so happy. Therefore, I\\'m happy Excellent resolution and speed. I love the easy usability of the new fire. I got this for my sister as a gift. So far so good. The price was just right. My daughter loves her tablet....she takes it with her everywhere! I had to sideload google play services to be able to download from the google play store or use google chrome as a web browser, as this tablet was designed to be exclusive to Amazon. I used daily and its works awesome, the price and performance are good I suggested to my friends , bought last yrs as well gave to my dad, he loves it. the kindle is all way a good product for the money the hold family have one just got me the 10\\' and love it get a Kindle and same money at the same time It\\'s big then the one I had I would tell my friends I purchased this Fire Tablet as a Christmas gift for my husband. He is learning to use it and so far likes it really well. He hasn\\'t downloaded any books yet but he now has an email address and will soon have a Facebook account. His brothers & sisters live around the country so now he will be able to keep in contact with them. Purchased for my granddaughter and it was a great investment. This little $60 tablet is really good for reading ebooks and watching netflix My Hulu plays perfectly..great volume. Kindle starts right up so I\\'m able to read fine. However, when I\\'m on Facebook and click on an article to read, it goes to the page, and within 30 seconds, the page closes. Sometimes Facebook app won\\'t even load. I find it blanking in and out and not showing some icons at times. I haven\\'t dropped it so I\\'m assuming this is an internal problem :( I have tried playing a couple games and it will say that I need \"the Amazon app\" where I go to purchase stuff, which I already have...then it closes out saying ERROR. I wish I could replace for a new one. Nice size screen, clear and clean picture with plenty of storage I bought two of these kindles. One for my preteen granddaughter whom had no problem at all being up and running. However, My senior mother found that the touch screen was not sensitive enough for the menu to drop easily for her. As a first time user on the kindle fire my mom will take time getting used to it. However, my tech savvy granddaughter loves her already. This replaced my old original kindle fire. What a great upgrade. Thought it was to be better than what it is. Mother in law can play games an Facebook on it. Next time I will buy her a samsung It was on a total of an hour and a half when the screen went completely dark. Would not turn on after that. The battery was fine....It just quit working all together. Bought this for my 9 year old Godson and he loves it. He would play it for hours on end if his parents would let him. He mostly plays games on it but he also uses it to watch videos and read books. Easily added apps including Google Play store... Not rocket science. Battery life is phenomenal, great for cross country flights. The granddaughter loves it and she can\\'t put it down. We bought this to replace a Kindle Fire pad and they have come a long way in this build, I would recommend this or if you like a bigger one then get then10\" version. Great build qualityGood screen resolution for the moneyCan install android applications -including kodi Like this so much bought another one for my daughter. My husband and I were looking around for a tablet for our daughter. We wanted something that she could use easily and we wouldn\\'t have to worry about what she was doing. With the different profiles and parental controls available we have enjoyed our choice of this tablet. Bought this for our granddaughter. She absolutely loves it! Easy for her to learn how to operate. First of all, this is not an iPad or a more expensive android tablet, but it\\'s a very good tablet for the money. I own an iPad Pro and iPad Air 2, yet this tablet has a place in my home. If you\\'re buying for kids, I wouldn\\'t buy anything more expensive than this. Good screen, fast enough, and amazon\\'s underground free apps are a huge plus. I bought this on super sale as an e-reader and to use to browse the web in lieu of a laptop when traveling. I found it to be a great value for the price. It processes rapidly on the web through its Amazon Silk browser. Streaming music also works well. The screen has nice resolution. It does not play well with other operating system apps and the apps available through Amazon does not compare to Google. I was unable to download a Google play app, although G mail works like a champ. The camera does not produce decent images. I wouldn\\'t bother with that function. All in all a terrific buy for the money, but don\\'t expect an iPad. Good tablet but not as smooth as high end tablets. It\\'s limited to Amazon so don\\'t expect to do as much as an Android or iPad. I like mine and will continue to use it. I recommend using one if you can before buying. I love it.....................!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! The Unit works exactly as described. A very good buy. Great tablet for price. Display is clear. Enjoy books on tablet. It\\'s unfair for me to rate this product cause I have not even taken it out of the box to set it up. Kids love it. Easy setup was ready with in minutes Working Product at the price that was advertised! Great! It\\'s nice really nice. Go buy one for your grandma. She will give you a real big hug. Easy to load, works with our local library (borrow books for free). I have been using this for a bit now. It\\'s wonderful. I also have another tablet but use the kindle exclusively for reading. The kindle works extremely. If you use amazon prime this is a no brainer. Great speed and function for a small price. Does what I needed. I would recommend to others great playing games reading surfing the Internet.Camera works very good and easy upload photos when needed. This tablet works as expected. I would recommend this tablet to anyone who needs a new tablet with great battery life. Very good tablet my child enjoys it very much, the battery life is very good although he takes it for his games Delivers as advertised. Very fast performance and the kids love it Absolutely love the tablet. My wife loves it. Much more enjoyable than playing on the phone. Not an iPad, but that\\'s not what I wanted. High quality, does everything I need it to do. Great purchase. Would definitely recommend it to anyone. Not very user friendly and intuitive.Very limited capabilities and apps.Good for viewing movies.Very limited language capabilities other than English and a few other languages.Apps are downloaded, but can\\'t be found. Now all 5 of my children have a kindle. This one is by far the best one. Currently setting everything up on it but so far so good. Very good price good item. Would purchase again. This was a gift I\\'ve had my Fire HD 8 2015 for about a year and have been very satisfied with it. My wife has been using an older Fire 7 (non-HD) and I thought it was time for an upgrade for her so I decided to buy her this new Fire HD 8 for Christmas. I also installed a sceen protector, a new case and a 64GB SD card before wrapping it.She was very surprised and pleased and she noticed the big difference in speed, sound and picture quality immediately. I\\'m very happy she likes it so much. Thanks Amazon for the great product and Best Buy for the great price. Very satisfied with my tablet ,it is very easy to operate. Purchased 2 of these and am real satisfied with them!! This actually was a Christmas present for my Mother, but I had to set it up. This is a nice upgrade from her Kindle purchased three years ago. Kindle was great assisting getting it registered since neither of us could remember her password. Great picture, just the right size and has the blue dimmer Met and exceeded all expectations! Easy to use, perfect size, arrived when expected and an excellent value. Not many apps. The first one was already returned...no power issue after 1week..I hope the second one is fine... awesome tablet. wonderful upgrade from the first kindle fire We are a Kindle family! Use them all the time! Reading books, checking email, watching Netflix. Would be very sad without it!!! For the money this tablet has a great display and allows you to do pretty much the same that lots of other more expensive devices are capable of. Bought this for my daughter for Christmas. She absolutely loves it! She has been on it since she opened it. Grandkids each got one and they love it. Step up from original Kindle. I recieved this as a present for my birthday, so far it has been great. I have bought several books and it makes a great Ebook reader. This is a great tablet for the price I paid. My husband loves it! Great tablet! My son really likes it to read and also to play games! Great buy for my 7yr old cheap so if it ends up broken for any reason I can replace it easily. Purchased for a family member. They love it. Would Recommend. I was always an IPad person but after having this I\\'m fine with it. It\\'s easy to use and inexpensive. Was happy to get the toy for my son for Christmas and they won\\'t stop playing it Purchased for mother in law as a Christmas gift and she loves it. She had a version 1 and she loved. She loves the better sound, picture and speed of the newer version. Bought for my daughter she loves it. Great investment for her watching movies!! Got this on sale for 69, decent display but you can tell it is not on par with other tablets. It is great if you have prime and use their services. Great speakes, makes a huge difference in Audio quality. Battert life is good, no complaints. I gave it 4 stars due to the play store access. There is a way around it, I do have it on here now but it took some work. Purchased two Fire8 tablets for my children. My son loves it for reading books from library and my daughter loves listening to audio books.They both were not sure they would like the tablet but they really love them. Love the HD8 the extra inch makes a huge difference over the HD7. I bought this on line as a gift. The unit does not stay on and I cannot get in touch with anyone to get the unit repaired This is a great device, and free\\'s up my phone. Great for internet, games, radio, etc. Simple to use. Great for Dad who wants to play games and check weather Product worked as described. No issues with performance, and it was a simple setup! Perfect for web browsing and videos. I love my tablet. It is super easy and loads fast. Bought this for a new tablet user. After a quick training session she caught right on. Perfect size for me. Speaker clarity is amazing and produces a great picture This is a great tablet without the steep cost of an iPad. I haven\\'t used it too much so far but the picture and sound is pretty good and being able to stream movies/shows is quite nice. I bought this fire for my 7 year old and she loves it. This is the first tablet i have owned and i must say it runs great. And the battery lasts for a good amount of time. Cant complain when it comes that cheap. The battery charge life is extended and everything else is fine. Great little tablet. Inexpensive so easy for taking with you without worry. This is a great value product and is (for me) an equal to an ipad. great tab in low price and worth to spend. It has everything what i am looking for. This kindle is very convenient and has a great display that\\'s easy on the eyes. I enjoy my kindle fire had it is easy to use get it I really like the bigger screen. These are great for traveling with children Hadn\\'t really checked into Kindles/tablets before. Does more than I expected it too, tho now I\\'m a little disappointed that it\\'s a little limited to Amazon-related and approved stuff. The app store for the device is more limited even tho it uses a form of Android (which means no Flash also). But I\\'m mostly using it for reading, so I\\'m happy with it and would recommend it. The 8 was the perfect size for me, the 6 screen was too small for reading comfortably and the 10 was too big as a handheld. This was an upgrade purchase. My previous Kindle was 4 years old. (still working!) This new version is so much faster and has a much better quality camera! Love it for reading, Netflix and on-line shopping! I don\\'t know why it takes long to come on and it goes off on me my kids have no problem Overall I am happy with my Amazon Fire 8 HD. It was easy to take and use on a recent trip, although the Delta app doesn\\'t work with it so that was a little frustrating. Not crazy about seeing the ads that pop up, but for a purchase price of $65 (sale), it\\'s hard to complain. This is my first tablet and I find it to be the perfect size and easy to use. I would recommend it to anyone who wants to buy a tablet and expects to use it for reading, surfing the web, playing games and as a lightweight device travel option. I am very happy with the look of the games and everything on the screen, I can see myself using it more at home now, although I will still use my laptop when I want a bigger screen. I bought it in the store & they were out of cases, so I recommend buying a case that also acts as a stand. I found one on Amazon that was inexpensive and came in an array of colors. Purchased this as a child\\'s tablet and I couldn\\'t be happier! I was buying it thinking that it would be cut-rate but ok for a small child to play with on long car rides and on rainy days. Despite the low cost and unimpressive stats I have been very surprised by the quality. The screen is perfectly adequate for games and kids shows, the parental controls/child profile settings are excellent and the stereo speakers CRUSH the built in speakers on my iPad Air 2. The only drawbacks I have found so far are power related. The battery seems to drain fairly quickly under what I would consider normal use and the included charger (typical usb type) takes a very very long time to fully charge the tablet. I suspect this is the charger\\'s limitation rather than the tablet\\'s and it may charge better with a different power supply.I wish that I had purchased two of these tablets at the price they were for sale and I would have kept the second for my own use when on the road. Gave this to my sister-in-law for Mother\\'s Day. Its a great entry level tablet. She loves using it, especially for games. I got this tablet for my dad after his old tablet bit the dust. He loves it! Great tablet and features! One of the fastest tablets I ever had. Netflix and Hulu works awesomely! I have the 2015 generation fire and it never worked all that great as far as speed but I enjoyed the feel and the visuals of it. I just purchased the 2016 version and it is remarkably faster than the previous model. Though the newer model doesn\\'t have as nice of a feel and the visuals are not as good. The newer version was much cheaper in price so it explains the feel and visuals. I hope someday they get a model that looks and feels great and is also quick. This is my third kindle fire. It is lightweight and unobtrusive. I use it mostly for reading however I have had no issues using it for web browsing or for playing games. Overall a good little tablet for the price. This was a Mother\\'s Day gift from my son. I had wanted one for awile. It has surpass my expectations. I love it. Perfect if you\\'re looking for the basic necessities of a laptop. Only negatives no yahoo apps, no google apps, no apple app, but it\\'s still awesome. I love my Amazon fire. I purchased one for my 17 year ol and she uses it to view Netflix,Hulu and you tube. I shop,email, surf the net and pay bills with mine:-)I bought an extra and downloaded my fire1. Now I have a fire 1 and a fire 2. My fire 1, my husband uses, so for back up I have a fire 2. It takes nice pics as well. The fire will make a very nice gift for someone oh, don\\'t forget your free books you can download!! Bought this as a gift/prize for a Project Graduation party. The winner was super excited! This kindle does everything i want and more. No regrets on the purchase I purchased this tablet for my mother-in-law and she loves it. Its fast, connects well, every amazon aspect of life you could possibly want is on here. Thats what I didnt expect, it being my first tablet. Amazon gets in your face about all its promos and products every time i turn it on. Its so annoying. -But its very handy, very sleek, easy to use and connects quick to any wifi acess around. However its limited on games and its app store is c.r.a.p compared to android. So ehhh 50/50. Late gift for my grandson. He is very happy with it. Easy for him (9yo ). I\\'m not super thrilled with the proprietary OS on this unit, but it does work okay and does what I need it to do. Appearance is very nice, price is very good and I can\\'t complain too much - just wish it were easier (or at least more obvious) to port new apps onto it. For now, it helps me see things that are too small on my phone while I\\'m traveling. I\\'m a happy buyer. I purchased this Kindle Fire HD 8 was purchased for use by 5 and 8 yer old grandchildren. They basically use it to play Amazon games that you download. Great tablet for a great price. No need to purchase an overpriced tablet for children I haven\\'t had my Fire long enough to have explored all it has to offer. I\\'ve downloaded a couple of audio books that sound great and are easy to install and play. Not my way to watch movies or TV but the screen is nice. Very clear and sharp. Audio is just OK from the speakers, you\\'ll want some nice head phones or buds for music or movies. I really like the Fire 8, it seems like a lot of gadget for the money. I use this tablet often. It is the perfect size. The battery last a long time. The quality is great for the price Easy operation, great product, not a fan of the shiny screen, hard to see in sunlight Love my purchase of my Amazon fire Hd 8. It was a very good experience Love it, vivid HD color, it replaces other devices I have. Watch movies, play games, read e books. Happy with the purchase, found it on sale could not pass it up! the salesgirl was very knowledgeable and helped me pick out the right tablet for my needs. It works well as promised. Good size screen and clarity for the money. Seems fairly robust. The biggest problem is putting apps on it, at least free games. They do not have a great selection and when I put them on some of them require you turn on tracking so they can collect information or they won\\'t let you play it Good tablet overall just not enough memory but with an sd card just love it It was great and great for the kids and adults thanks my 9 yr old loves her new tablet . she had a nabi and likes this better Love the Tablet. Wonderful battery life. Great for Movies. This is a good tablet for the price. I dont have a lot of apps. I use more for reading and watch videos. I think is a good deal. I bought this item for one of my interns and she loved it. it\\'s a great tablet for the money. I would buy another. It does everything I need a table to do. And it is really fast.. The product has a $90 price tag and the 90 warranty is too short. My tablet died within a month. I took it to Best Buy where they said they don\\'t handle the warranty, went to Amazon web site where they said go to the store where I bought the device. After much digging around Amazon web site I found out who would help me. I gave it a one star and Amazon helped me quick. We were able to get it going again, a manual would help. The device works again. I found the tablet to be very functional, I watch Netflix, listen to Spotify, watch YouTube videos, it works great! Excellent product for what it does. Spouse loves it!Nough said! Easy to use and lots of handy features. Downside is the ads that apparently can\\'t be shut off and you can\\'t upload and and play downloaded YouTube videos unless you are online. Works great for my teenage son. He uses it for reading, playing games, and watching movies I purchased this tablet for my granddaughter and she just loves it...so much I have to take on the week days ... I love this kindle works great for me I will be ordering another one today for my wife. \\xa0I needed a tablet to keep at the hospital during overnight stays so I decided based on price to get the kindle 8 and I am pleased I did! For only $89 the bright picture, sound, storage, and ease of use is well worth it. This is a great tablet for downloading books & movies. It also takes pictures as well as surfing the web. All in all very satisfied with purchase Very Nice upgrade! Love the speed to watch movies and to play games! I broke my Fire 7 and decided to move up to the 8 and could not be more happy. I bought this for reading but love the extras. Works great! Great reading options. I like my Amazon fire-easy to use - user friendly.I liked the size - 8\" . It has made my life much easier since having hand surgery! Easy to check my email and other uses! Absolutely love my kindle. There was a glare on the screen when I was out in the sun, but once my eyes got adjusted it was just fine! I was looking for a tablet within a reasonable price range, after doing a little research I decided to give the kindle a try and it was a GREAT decision! It has so many uses and makes it so much easier to get things done than using my phone. I would recommend for any age. I love my new kindle. It was a birthday gift to myself. Best decision I could have made. A lot of bells and whistle. I love it because it was to navigate. Heck, I am doing this review on my kindle. Best Fire tablet at a reasonable price. Much faster than the 7 inch. I like the size of the device as well as the expandable storage Bought this for my wife to replace her old one and she loved it Good enough for the price. Great for Amazon subscriptions and Amazon shopping. I enjoy the kindle fire but it is not meant for heavy lifting. Good for reading books and web searching but Amazon App store doesnt have many of the normal apps found in Google Play or Apple App Store. Great value for the price however wonderful, I have 3 more at home, worth the money. This is my second Amazon Fire. My first was the 7 inch and love the new 8 HD. I am impressed with the quality and speed of this tablet. I was a little worried about not having access to the Google Play store, but this has not been a big issue so far. The speed, functionality, and battery life have exceeded my expectations. Good for price. One should not expect the quality of iPad from this product Bought the device as a gift for someone and so can\\'t comment on the usage, however it was a good price for a device that seems very versatile to me. Bought this for my mom and she loves it. Very user friendly The only thing that I don\\'t like about it is that the screen is not made to be seen in the sunlight. If I wanted to take it to the beach or poolside to read, I would not be able to see it in the sunlight. Otherwise it is terrific! It\\'s a nice updated tablet. No problems yet. Decent price for what you get Replacement tablet for my wife - no complaints! She watches Netflix on it a lot. This tablet was inexpensive, very lightweight, and performs just as good as the more expensive ones. A rating of 3 starts is what I can give this product. The Fire HD8 show a nice picture and is used mostly to watch NetFlix. However, the Fire HD8 will restart when the battery indicators is at 35%. I am not sure what is causing the issue or why. Good product for listening to and reading books. Also works well when u don\\'t want to carry an expensive and heavy laptop. We use this for streaming and games. It is a great value for the money. My wife got this for her Kindle books so she can read on the go Mom likes this allot, once she started using it. She was hesitant at first because it\\'s something new! But that didn\\'t last long. Nice screen, got it at discounted price for my kid, replaced a smaller one he broke. Tip add a child proff cover. The migration executive experience amazing! Picked up from cloud and i was good to go! Good features, good cost. Recommend to anyone looking for tablet. Great product... easy to use! Compatible with everything I want to use it for. Bought this for my son,, the size is perfect not too small not too big. Kid friendly..and easy to use. Overall o rate it 5 stars..no problems to list I purchased this to download books for school. Screen too small and OS was not to my liking If you want a simple tablet to watch shows and play games this is it. The constant ads from Amazon are annoying however. Love this tablet. Easy to use. And price was right Bought it for tbe grandson to play games on. It is ok for that. I have had Nook tablets before and I think tbey are a little better than the Amazon. It does fine for what we bought it for. This is a great tablet for people that are new to tablets and do not want to spend much money on it. It\\'s a very nice tablet and very economic tool, my kids enjoy it and I love the parental controls too This was a present for my son, but he seems to be enjoying it, so it must be ok Nothing but problems after a month. Luckily I could take it back and get a credit for the kindle to put towards an ipad. It started off working fine then after a month it started losing internet connection randomly (while the old ipad had no problems). Then it stopped charging, never got past 1%. Tried different outlets, different android chargers. Nothing. Worthless It\\'s definitely a must have. I like to read books also browse social media and the web. Must have I really was looking for a simple, cheap tablet to play games and mess around on. Screen is really nice and it serves it\\'s purpose well. Video and games both work really well on them. The only real negative about the tablet is that the cameras are not good. I really don\\'t need them so I don\\'t use them and it\\'s not a big deal for me. Our daughter loves her new tablet. It has a bigger screen more features and she just enjoys being on it. The kindle is priced right and is easy to use. She was able to get her apps transferred to her new tablet in no time. Great investment. Best tablet for the money and then some, loads fast, good quality graphics too. I needed to upgrade my electronics since I haven\\'t bought a tablet in a couple of years. What I had at home wouldn\\'t stream what I wanted to see. I went in looking for a 10in and came out with this 8in after the sales assoc. showed me its features & answered my questions. Much more portable than a 10in would have been too. If you are looking for a tablet to read books, play games, watch netflix or amazon, and to travel with, look no further. This tablet has everything you need. it does not have the greatest camera, but you have a phone for that. No reason to spend more money on anything else. You get what you pay for... This is not great, the functionality and limitations leave much to be desired. Should have spent more and got another Samsung Galaxy Tab. Great for travel when you want to read in vacation. I really love my kindle its easy to handle to. I have 3. was cheap, can not run chrome stuff, returned to store. Bought this for my mom as an upgrade to her older non-HD Kindle Fire and it is an improvement on all fronts - bigger better screen, better speakers, faster processor and updated operating system plus a slot for external storage. Great price for what you get. Got this at a great price as a second tablet. The battery life is so good that I use when traveling for movie watching. Great screen and quick response times. I love my amazon fire tablet. It\\'s great to watch movies on and surf the web. I bought my daughter the kindle fire so i purchased the kindle 8 for me Better than nook also cheaper. If toy areally looking to use as a tablet not the best choice. Great for reading and basic searching. Love this tablet. Great price and does everything Iwas looking for in a tablet All four of my kids have this Kindle. They does freeze every now and again, but overall they are great. The new camera is not a favorite. The last version camera was better. My wife broke her kindle, so we tried the fire and she has loved it! About what you\\'d expect from Kindle. Bluetooth connectivity, battery life all good I bought this tablet to replace another one that had died. it works of my purposes but one thing to note this is an Amazon device and does not have google play services installed. all apps come from amazon market. I enjoy using this Kindle fire 8\". The apps are easy to install, the screen is a great size. I can even use it without my glasses. Got this tablet for my mother and liked it so much that I went and got one for myself! It runs fast for what I use it for! I bought this tablet for my 13 yr. old God-child and she loves it. This was her Christmas present. Bought it for my wife she loves it and I would but one for my self too Excellent value, great product. It has a really solid feel. I am very happy with the purchase. Have had a nook and this is easier to use and greater variety of uses and I greatly prefer it. Great apps,ease of use,love the 8in screen, camera not that great, better pics on phones this a great tablet, my grandaughter uses the kindle settings for her little girl who is in pre school This is an upgrade we purchased for Mom. She was able to use it with no problem. Alot like her previous Kindle Very happy with the Kindle tablet! Bought it to replace an old Kindle tablet. Great tablet, serves the purpose well. Basic browsing, netflix and amazon videos.Only issue is my older tablet had a mini hdmi not this one, so screen connect is only through Amazon echo.Still a good tablet! I use it to stream movies while on the tread mill at the gym This is a great Tablet at a really great price. The best part is if you happen to break it just buy a new one Bought this to replace one I had from about 6 years ago. Why did I wait so long. The newer models bigger screen is so nice and it\\'s so much faster! I HAVE NOTHING BUT GOOD THINGS TO SAY. I HAVE HAD NO PROBLEMS WITH THE TABLET AND IT KEEPS A GREAT CHARGE. GOT IT FOR A GREAT PRICE! I had bought this tablet for my sister who is wheel chair bound or she lays in her bed. She gets a lot of Joy from using the tablet.Its big screen helps her see things better. Upgraded from the original Kindle not sure why we waited so long. Works great!! Would recommend for anyone looking for a good product. Very kid friendly! WAS LOOKING FOR A NEW TABLET. .. GREAT PRICE FOR THIS ONE! This is perfect for him! Bought it as a reader for his books, which we either download from Amazon Prime or the local public library. Nice quality screen resolution, ease of use and durability are a plus. My grandson loves it, uses it all the time. Its great Great reader and tablet enjoy the video graphics nice unit. Really love my Fire HD. Very easy to browse the internet. Is an excellent EBook Reader. Amazon apps are great! The screen is big and the Kindle is easy to navigate. Having Amazon prime definitely makes it worth the investment Bought this for my elderly non-tech friendly mom. Because it\\'s so user friendly she\\'s able to navigate it and enjoy its features without assistance. It is better than we expected and couldn\\'t be happier. We love this tablet. I bought it for my 4 and 6 year old daughters for Christmas. They have been able to used them with ease. This is for my 10 year old. Love the parental settings This was my 3rd Kindle and 2nd Fire Kindle!!! I use it for EVERYTHING!!! Hardly use the laptop at ALL anymore. Would HIGHLY recommend!!! Mainly used for reading kindle books, but tablet does many other things! Goes with me everywhere I go! When I decided on this I was shopping for something but didn\\'t know what. After using I have decided this is it. Does all I need. I bought this tablet for my 4 year old granddaughters birthday and she loves it. Works well and it is easy for her to operate. Got as a gift for my mom for Mother\\'s Day . Really great This screen on the hd8 is a huge improvement over the past kindle or fire devices. The operating system is sometimes glitchy, but overall a nice system for the money. Be sure to join Amazon Prime and have access to lots of free reading downloads Affordable and kid friendly. My kids watch videos and play games on these a lot. Lots of apps, games and books to choose from! I bought this tablet to replace my old kindle fire. So far, it has exceeded my expectations. All my apps have transferred flawlessly. The battery lasts me 10-12 hours, with moderate internet use. Glad I made this purchase. We needed a new tablet and after some research this one seemed to fit our needs. Would definitely recommend this to anyone that is looking for a tablet. These two boys were thrilled with the Fire tablet. Every time I see them they are glued to the tablet. They both have said it is the best present EVER. Extra points to the grandfather on these gifts! Unsure if I wanted to get another kindle or an Amazon tablet. Very happy with my purchase. Easy to use and a great price! This is a great Amazon Fire HD8. I love the size. So much better than my first Kindle. has good download speed. great color and clarity. sound also very good Bought for grandson ,he loves it\\'s! He uses it daily after home work done. it was a good buy for when the had them on sale. I use it as my travel tablet I love this Kindle Fire....I bought it as a reader but really about the only thing I can\\'t do on it is make phone calls. Great price for a great product. The Fire 8 was purchased for me for after I had a knee replacement. I used it to view and check my emails, facebook, Netflix, Xfinity movies and TV shows. I had an older Kindle but it got a virus. The only thing I have against this one is that it gets very hot. Best Buy did not carry covers for it. got as a replacement for young child. worked well for him. This is a great value tablet, great screen great apps. Highly recommend for media/games. I\\'ll probably buy another We bought one for my son and he liked it so much we bought another one for my other son. We did upgrade to the 8 inch screen. Purchased it for in law. She loves it and has no problems with it. I bought this as a Christmas present on Black Friday for an incredible price Easy to use and has a lot of games and books available. Good memory and you can\\'t beat the price! I\\'m planning on returning this tablet just as soon as I can!` I bought this to replace a 3-year old Kindle Fire 7\" HDX that I had just dropped on the floor. I sort of panicked, so after doing a couple of hours of research I picked this tablet. Just to be on the safe side I got 16 additional GB of memory. I installed a couple of games (none of them memory hogs) and a cookbook app, in addition to downloading a couple of books and dictionaries. I can honestly say this is the slowest tablet I\\'ve ever had. Just rotating the screen takes 7-10 seconds, and that\\'s if there\\'s only one app open. Opening a book or magazine can take half a minute, and God help you if you want to switch between a recipe and a magazine while you\\'re cooking! Amazon is obviously more concerned about showing you constant special offers and apps than having satisfied customers. Since there are no other Fire tablets available for whatever reason (maybe they\\'re being discontinued?) I\\'ll be replacing it with either an iPad or a Galaxy tablet. Great starter tablet for any one looking to not spend much money. I bought this for a gift and my little niece got in love with it HD 8\" tablet 16G on sale for $64.99 thats $25 dollars less then ever before. And alexa included. Glad I upgraded to the Fire Kindle as it is much easy to read on than the black and white Kindle I had previously. The color and graphics are very clear. It is easy to work on for many tasks, and the search mode is great. Overall I am satisfied with the tablet. Nice looking screen and decent sounding speakers. Loads of content kids and adults. Nice device! This is our first tablet, we were looking for a tablet to get us started and this is nice and inexpensive way to get started. We will use this for a while to get used to the whole app thing. I bought this to replace an older kindle that broke. It has more features, like front/ rear facing camera and better resolution screen. I feel like it doesn\\'t work as well though. The screen doesn\\'t always respond. The Internet freezes a lot. The colors seem to be a little off. All in all, still a decent piece for the price. I purchased the Kindle fire to replace my iPad that stopped working. It is so much easier to use and lighter than an iPad. I wish I had purchased one years ago. Kindles are easy to carry when traveling on long flights. Can\\'t believe I waited so long to get a real e-reader. So easy to read from. Nice tablet from Amazon, has a good screen on it and plenty of memory. My grandson loves it! It\\'s exactly what he needed. I\\'m very pleased with it, and so is he! I loved my old kindle but this new kindle is easy to use and has added security that I didn\\'t have with my old kindle. as above but interface is confusing and swipes are sometimes not recognized. Great for games and reading. Price was great. Great battery life. Well worth the money. Its awesome and of course better than the last gen. Love the HD screen. Picked this up in hopes the kids would read more than usual. It worked not only that but the entire family enjoys it. Perfect size. Exactly what I was looking for. Highly recommend this to anyone. It works fine, but sensitive to swipe on one side. This tablet has worked perfectly since I got it in April. The special offers are only on the lock screen and it works with all my apps. It\\'s very responsive and the screen resolution is great. Easy to use and great selection of books movies and games. We got these as an upgrade for the kids\\' Kindle Fires. Work great and have had no issues. The specs are good, feels solid, can\\'t stand the OS. Too many ads you can\\'t get rid of, not as customizable as I\\'d like. If that doesn\\'t bother you, it\\'s a good tablet for the price. Don\\'t expect to run games on it, not powerful enough for that. I bought one and gave this one as a gift- much appreciated and great price. I needed something that\\'s not an ipad for basic app use and it works great, minimal glare even with a screen protector (again, it\\'s not iPad, but it\\'s good for a tablet) Very easy to use and does everything I need it to do. I use it to read emails and watch Netflix Very easy to use. The Kindle app works well. Regular tablet search simple games email all work fine sometimes a little slow. I used this as my travel tablet and teader. The advertising is a pain but helps keep the price down. Goo graphics and easy to use. Does much more than you think. A perfect gift. Great Fire tablet! Speedy service and experience! Bravo! This is a cheap tablet but really worth for the price. I bought this when it is on sale for $69 + $40 for 128 GB SD card, you have a great tablet when plenty of space. I used ipad for a while but i think it is so overpriced . This tablet is a deal !!! Excellent replacemwnt for an older model of rhe kindle. This is our 2nd one, my wife was using my most of the time, so I got her one. good little tablet. I use it for entertainment. no issues hooking it up to my network. It reads my textbooks to me while I play card games. Why did I wait so long to buy this thing? I should add that I am an Amazon Prime member so that might be needed to take full advantage of this feature. Cortonna will read all of my books to me. I didn\\'t have to upgrade my books or pay extra per book. Got this for my mom, so she could check facebook without getting on her computer. So far, no problems, even tho she\\'s not tech savvy. Enjoy having a device that I did not have to pay for through the nose. Enjoy having a device that makes it easier to read on the go. Great light weight tablet that uploads quickly. Would recommend. I need a tablet for reading ebooks and search dictionary for new vocabulary. This one fit my need and it can also check email, listen music and go online searching stuff. I have iPad at home and put this at office, so I don\\'t need to bring the same tablet back and forth. It suits my need very well. This is a very responsive device for the amount paid Amazon - Fire HD8 - 8 - Tablet - 16GB - Wi-Fi - Black I purchased this for my sister. I really appreciate the Geek Squad for setting this product up for her and for teaching me how to use it. Now I can pass that I learned onto my sister. Kindle was great purchase for both of my teenage sons.Great for use of apps and music. Good for everyday use. Would recommend to anybody. Inexpensive, but well built. Easy navigation. Streams movies well. Sound is decent, but requires headphones generally. Screen is good size and clear. Finding a case for this model is a challenge - I found on-line, but expensive considering tablet price. Universal cases don\\'t work due to button placement. 8 years old daughter is happy with this tables,work very well with wifi and is easy to download app. Perfect for basic stuff, games and media. Reading, too. Fast working tablet but very limited on apps. I like it but it was not really for me. Only apps available were from the Amazon app store so many apps that I hoped to use were unavailable. So it is good for limited use. Purchased for book reading but works well as a tablet. Wasn\\'t thinking that it would be a full replacement for my old IPad but working well as one. Prior to using the device I decided to recharge it to 100% and was shocked to find out that it takes 6 hours. Unless you have a lot of time don\\'t buy this device. whats to say.................................................it\\'s Kindlelishous!!!!!!!!!!!!! I purchased this as a Mother\\'s Day gift for my Mom in Florida. I don\\'t have first hand experience with it but the price point is great and the other reviews seem solid. I did watch a few unboxing videos on youtube and it seems to be a great deal. Some people seem to have issues with the screen being too glossy but other than that I don\\'t see a ton of other problems. This tablet has beautiful color graphics and is super thin. Easy to carry with you. This fit my criteria of a low cost tablet that works well My son loves his new tablet. He goes on it as soon as he gets home from school. and it holds a LOT of data plus you can add more storage... been using it a lot. Better than I expected. Parental control is an awesome feature. I was looking for a kids tablet for my grandson but this one is so much better because it can grow with him and it has a kids mode on it which is really nice so he can\\'t order or go online without permission. He loves this tablet and it\\'s very well build . We bought the Fire as an easy way for our 97 year old mother to see pictures of the family from all over the country. It was very simple to set up and learn to use. She plays games on it, as well...... Cant beat it for the money, plus its very durable.... My 8 year old niece cracked her screen on her former tablet, I needed to get her a replacement. This tablet fit the bill exactly, a great screen, relatively fast CPU, and best of all, it\\'s cheap!I was able to find instructions online for installing Google PlayStore, in which I then gave her the tablet. She loves it! I love the Amazon HD8! It is a great tablet for reading and surfing the web! It has a fast processor and amazing resolution. I would definitely purchase this product again. Great product for my 8 year & affordable.. had 2 months & no problems Great but I wouldn\\'t use it for a sole purpose as being my primary tablet A perfect tablet at a reasonable cost. Why pay higher prices for bells and whistles you don\\'t use. The back lit feature is great for reading in low light conditions. I got a kindle fire when they first came out. Time to update and great choice, good graphic, great for catching up on your favorites show better than watching on a phone!! The Kindle Fire HD is perfect for playing simple games and for streaming video while away from home. It\\'s thin and light. Bought this for my daughter. She loves it. Wifi connection is great. She mostly uses YouTube and google. Love the easy way to control parental accounts from my account. Very useful. I did buy a cover to put on it, because it\\'s so thin, I was afraid it would break. I bought this tab for my daughter\\'s birthday.its got a good screen and sound for the price. I also play for the children\\'s app freetime which is perfect for her. Really good tablet. Very nice picture. Really easy to use. I needed a kindle for my schooling so I decided to look into this and read some reviews. After reading the reviews I decided on this kindle and it is perfect compared to my other tablet. Like the ability to play a game or 2 when I take a break from reading... Easy to use, light weight, fits in a small purse or bag. I like the Amazon Platform that it is on as it ties into my Amazon account. still learning new things about my tablet. very easy to use.. perfect size. We have been using our Kindle Fire 7 for years and it wore out. We looked at replacing it with another Fire 7 until I saw the Fire 8. The display is great and the weight is not that big of a difference. Enjoy the multifaceted opportunities that are available with the Kindle This tablet is very easy to set up and use- it\\'s just as advertised. I had the original Kindle and just decided to upgrade. It \\u200bis a very functional and easy to use. My 10 year old daughter loves it. Battery great to Several friends suggested I buy the Kindle Fire. I love it!! Great for traveling! I can check my email, update my Facebook status and read all from one device. I had a new one but it stopped working....So I just went and bought a new one. Works great!! Loved it very good screen quality and clarity, of course its amazon so alot of the regular google play store stuff from androids isnt Available, but they have there own version of stuff that is good also, my kids loved it, i loved it, i highly recommend buying it. But if your hooked on google play id go with a Samsung tablet. Very lightweight and portable with excellent battery life. I like this so much more than the Voyage. The shape makes for easier holding. I only wish this devise was maybe 2 inches taller then it would look like a real book Replacing older reader without a light and traveling overseas soon. With electronics in the cabin under scrutiny, this very small and very lightweight reader fits the bill! Perfect in small purses and large pockets. I can read without annoying seatmate with cabin overhead seat light. Easy to hold in either hand and screen adjusts for whichever direction you\\'re holding it. This is my first e-reader. I didn\\'t know about the odd refresh and it took a little while to get used to but I do love how small and light it is and that I do not have to remember to plug it in everyday This kindle is awesome. I love the design of it. Nothing software wise that was different than my other kindle but the way it\\'s designed makes it much more comfortable and easier to read. The only reason I didn\\'t give it five stars was because of the price. If it were cheaper, this kindle would have been five stars no doubt. The new Kindle is a great gift and fantastic entertainment idea. Met all my expectations! Lightweight and compact. I enjoy using the product. I thought long and hard about upgrading from my paperwhite, but decided to do so despite not beating able to actually see one in the store. I have owned a Kindle since the second generation version. This is by far my favorite. The look and feel are amazing. I don\\'t regret the purchase one bit as I have the disposable income to do so, but for most the paperwhite will more than suffice at a significantly smaller price point. I own a Kindle HDX 8.9 and wanted something small and portable... WOW is all I can say when I got my hands on the Kindle Oasis ( Thank you Babes :) ). The Kindle Oasis is very tiny, portable & fits in about anything from a jeans back pockets to a very very small purse! The clarity of the screen is awesome. The touch of it works perfect! Very different than my HDX BUT I HIGHLY RECOMMEND it! A little more pricey than the paperwhite BUT this one already comes with the case and a built in battery in the case so you are set for long time reading & the price is fair since the others you would still have to buy a case for it! Keep in mind the case for the oasis is leather and you can choose from black, brown and red (red was my choice., which to me it\\'s not red it\\'s more of a wine red color) it\\'s beautiful! Picture shows My Kindle Oasis in the middle of the IPhone 7 Plus (left) & Samsung S8+ (right) so you can get an idea on the size... it\\'s super cute! It\\'s tinier than the Kindle paperwhite! Got me reading again! Love the merlot cover. This one is the smallest of all the kindle products I believe, and that\\'s a big reason I picked. Also the lightest I believe. Battery life is forever.Two negative points are the Amazon logo in the cover, and the fact you can\\'t do inverted text (black background white text).Those 2 points dropped it from 4 to 5 star for me.Still highly recommended. easy to read books this way. enjoyable at night in the bedroom or outside in the afternoon. I purchased the Kindle Oasis because I was growing increasingly tired of the glare and cumbersome size of reading off my iPad. So the portability is great. And of course, I went for the most expensive, because I wanted the extra battery life. And while the length of time it stays charged is nice, charges very quickly, it\\'s still overpriced. I love the non-glare screen, you can literally read this anywhere. But the wifi connectivity is patchy at best. I have to go upstairs in my home and stand close to the router for the Oasis to connect, this is very annoying. Wouldn\\'t be a big deal if I only read from this one device. But I read from another and picking up where I left off is a pain most times. Non of my issues are really a big deal, but for $300 I don\\'t feel like I should have any issues. This is my second Kindle and I couldn\\'t be happier . I couldn\\'t believe I would be happy with something so small , but it is great And easy to take along anywhere . I started to buy the Voyage but when I saw how close the price was to the Oasis, I decided to go ahead and buy the Oasis. So glad I did! I love the case and the physical buttons to turn the page. It is so lightweight and I love the option of the screen rotating whenI need to change hands. Awesome device! Was afraid to spend so much money for a kindle but so far I am glad I did. Love everything about it. The buttons to turns pages, screen resolution, lighting, how easy and light it is when you hold it. Case is beautiful. Enjoy reading on it. Great item! Would definitely recommend this item -- am still learning all the things about it. This product may be extremely overpriced, but it also lives up to everything it\\'s promised. It\\'s a lightweight, long-lasting ereader that is much easier on the eyes than an iPad. It is much lighter and more ergonomical than a paperback, and I find myself renting kindle copies of books I already own just to take advantage of the device\\'s convenience. Upgraded from my old Kindle keyboard. I love the ability to adjust brightness and font. I have small hands and this is not too big to hold in one hand. I was able to change the page turning buttons for left handed use. The charging cover last a long time. I wish there were more colors to choose from. This is not an upgrade by any means! My three year old kindle outperformed Oasis.Battery life better than a week with the lights on lowest setting Magnetic connector is poorly designed and grows weak Two pieces to keep up with; unsnaps constantly Amazon Customer Services promises it will resolved in an update Its a great ereader but a little pricy. It has the same specs as the Voyage as far as pixels and procesor, which costs less. The only difference between this and the Voyage, is that it\\'s much lighter, it\\'s brighter (LEDs), and a longer battery life if you\\'re using the cover. I\\'ve noticed the battery life drains much faster without the cover, but you\\'ll still be able to read for hours without it. You would think it be water resistant, hence the name but it isn\\'t. But then I don\\'t plan on reading when it\\'s raining or outside or while taking a bath. Overall, it\\'s the best ereader Amazon currently has to offer but if you don\\'t mind the price tag and want the best, then go for it! Voyage is still not a bad option though Great ebook for a beginner. Light and good looking I have had a Kindle for some time and was curious about the Oasis. It did not disappoint. It is very compact, even with the cover, and fits in a coat pocket. I really enjoy the size and the redesign which brings back hard buttons. Great device for home or on the go. Battery life is unreal! So much faster than my old kindle. This Kindle reader with cover attached is light weight and easy reading. Page turner is easy to use and it reverses so you can hold with either hand. I am very happy and satisfied with this product. Happy reading - The new design, compared to my old kindle paperwhite and voyage, looked weird when I first got my Kindle Oasis. After I used it for a while (5 hours), I felt the design was kind of make sense. When I hold it with one hand (right hand), the centre of gravity position was right in my hand, so there was less change that I drop the kindle on my face(when I was laying on my bed, it happened a lot with my kindle voyage) I\\'ve been a kindle owner since the early days and when new versions have come out in the past, it was usually a no-brainier to upgrade. The oasis was a little challenging because the price really makes you stop and think if this upgrade is worth it. After a lot of thought, the factor that convinced me to switch was the reappearance of the page turning buttons. I missed them since they vanished with the kindle keyboard! The paper white and the voyage were great devices but I often accidentally changed pages if I accidentally pinched the bezel when carrying the device or even just shifting positions on the couch. The Oasis\\' buttons have removed that issue and I am delighted! The weight and thinness of the device are also appreciated tho the paper white etc are pretty thin already. The addition of the cover is interesting but after a month\\'s use I think it\\'s pretty clear the cover/battery is there only to boost the very short-lived battery in the kindle itself. \"Months\" of battery life just seems impossible unless you keep the screen at low illumination and only read a few minutes a day. The screen is clear and bright, I can\\'t see any LED issues others have complained about and the interface does seem snappier than older versions. Ultimately the only real justification for buying this kindle is if you miss the page turn buttons and want to pay top dollar for them. Otherwise, the existing kindles will meet your needs. I would definitely buy it again, but it does not have the ambient light sensor like the cheaper voyage does to turn the brightness up and down automatically in the dark or sun. For a product of this price, it shouldn\\'t be missing any features. Otherwise it is great, light, and the text refreshes quickly and is crisp. Very nice Kindle with a great Battery life. My old kindle was not able to upgrade so I got the new Kindle and very pleased with the product. Arrived as promised from BESTBUY.COM. This is a great device. It is ultra light, and a pleasure to use. It also has a very satisfying premium feel. The price, of course, is not worth it.. unless you can afford it. There are cheaper models of the kindle with similar screen resolution....but if you CAN afford it, I highly recommend it. Th size difference is noticeable and squarish rather then rectangular, which I prefer. The Kindle unit itself is rather nice, the auto rotate and adjust being the best part. I returned this item b/c the cover is flimsy. and I was afraid I would drop it and break the kindle. lightweight and convenient to use. love my new kindle I purchased this as a gift for my wife and she loves it. She has an older Kindle, and she can\\'t believe how much better the Oasis is. Kindles are an excellent device for all book lovers Great for reading in the sunlight. As well as light, and easy on the wrist. Great product, but a little speedy. As a previous several Kindle device owner I read a lot of reviews, many of them put the Voyage above it for various reasons, mainly price, or battery charging. But, after reading the pros and cons of both I still decided the Oasis was the direction I wanted to go, I could always return it and get the Voyage after all if I didn\\'t like it. It\\'s light, very well lit, comfortable to hold both in the case and out of it. The buttons improve the page turning experience, I see no dark areas on my screed from the LED lights, it holds a great battery charge (true not as good as my previous Kindle, but I still generally get around 3 weeks between charges), and it looks absolutely beautiful. I am very happy with this purchases and am glad I purchased the Oasis over the Voyage. It\\'s expensive, and that\\'s the major con, but if you want the best reading device this is it and worth it if you read enough. New to eBooks and researched available eReaders and tablets. What I like best about the OASIS is the weight (lightest on the market), battery life (measured in weeks not hours) and the capability to use it in bright sunlight. Recommend it for all. I am a book addict and this is my 4th kindle device. This is by far the best one. It is so compact it is almost smaller than my large wallet. Can fit anywhere. Holds a charge incredibly well and very nice display to make reading fun. I read a lot and have loved my kindle paperwhite and used it all the time. I didn\\'t think it could get any better! I read all about the kindle Oasis and it sounded great but the price was freaking me out and I kept thinking I really didn\\'t need it! Well I finally talked myself into just trying it and after just taking it out of the box and holding it I was sold. It is so lightweight and so easy to hold and the screen is wonderful! The charging case is so convenient and so easy to take off and put on and it really looks nice. I never keep it on when I\\'m reading which keeps the kindle oasis light. I am so glad that I went for it and bought it. I want to read more than ever now. It is always in my purse. Believe me, I am not made of money in the least but I am so glad that I purchased this. If you are an avid reader you will be too! Excellent reader night or day, sunshine or shade. Not as full function as earlier kindels There\\'s no doubt that this is the best Kindle device available. The battery life is astonishing, and the design is unique and extremely ergonomic. Holding this in your hand is such a pleasurable experience, it fits like a glove. So what are the cons you may ask...For one, the battery life depends on the provided case. It acts like a travel charger in a sense. Why a con? Well, it limits your customization options. And there\\'s no way to purchase other colors or replacements for it at this time. So, you best be cautious with it.And two, the price obviously! But if you take into account that you basically are given a premium case, the device itself is a premium device, and you have a traveling charge inside the case...It may almost even out. But a $290-$350 device is hard to justify when it\\'s just for reading.Still would recommend to any fan of e-readers/reading Nice device. But only minimally better than the Voyage. \\'ve owned the Kindle Keyboard, 2nd generation Paperwhite and now the Oasis. I love the Oasis very much. The ergonomic design is wonderful and makes it a breeze to hold. It is so light -- that is the biggest killer feature of the Oasis. The 10 LEDs look fantastic and I love the return of page buttons. I\\'ve never had one where the screen is flush with the bezel so this is great. All in all, this is easily the best Kindle ever made and even though it\\'s a bit spendy, it will be the one future Kindles are measured against. I have had every kindle since the first and this is by far the best. The screen was already great on the Voyage but the front light on this screen is more white and more evenly distributed. Physical page turn buttons are so much better than none or the haptic feedback type. They didn\\'t include the automatically adaptive front light for some reason but I don\\'t think I\\'ll miss it much as I was always wont to fiddle with it on the Voyage anyway.But this device made me smile as soon as I held it for the first time because it has a larger bezel that you can really grip comfortably without touching the screen. Maybe this isn\\'t a big deal for most, but that is exactly why I spent the money to get this device.The other thing I was hoping for was the ability to use the upper page turn button to go forward and this device does that and even better because it is software configurable.The cover is very small and light and doesn\\'t add much bulk like the Voyage Origami case does. The only downside is that it doesn\\'t work as a hands free stand for reading.(I still wish it was waterproof) Despite not being able to get one of these from Amazon until late June due to apparent strong demand, Best Buy was able to get one to me on the day of its release, April 27. Well done Best Buy! Having owned several previous Kindles, including the most recent Paperwhite model, I was unprepared for how small and light this new Oasis model is -- reading about it is one thing, but actually holding one in your hand is something else entirely. The Oasis and its battery-charging cover together weigh only one ounce more than the latest Paperwhite with no case. The Oasis _without_ its cover feels impossibly light at 4.6 ounces. Size-wise, the Oasis is nearly a square shape at about 5\" wide by 5.5\" tall. In fact, the shape is so different from traditional Kindle designs that I had to compare it next to my Paperwhite to verify that the screens are actually the same size (they are). It\\'s the first Kindle I think I could easily fit into a jacket pocket without any effort, For frequent travelers like me, this is a key reason to buy one of these, as it\\'s extremely compact and easy to pack in a briefcase or purse. The screen is the first front-lit Kindle I\\'ve ever seen where you simply cannot see any trace of the LEDs from any angle. No dark spots, no bright spots...just a completely uniform illumination from edge to edge in both directions. The \"page\" also appears to be nearly flush with the top glass surface, helping achieve the illusion of printed paper. It\\'s sharp and clear, better than any Kindle I\\'ve used. The reader can be easily separated from the battery case by simply pulling them apart, since they are held together with magnets. After doing so, this is where the Amazon engineering team\\'s achievements really become clear, as you just won\\'t believe how lightweight this thing is. It\\'s easy to imagine holding onto it for hours without any arm fatigue, and switching from hand to hand is a simple matter of rotating it 180 degrees when switching. The display instantly rotates, and the page turn buttons also \"follow\", with the top button always used to advance the page, and the bottom button always used to go backward. You can also use the screen to change pages as you always have with earlier touch screen models. The battery on the reader has a lower capacity than the cover\\'s battery, so it runs down faster if you don\\'t have it connected to the case. It\\'s very easy to snap the reader back into its cover, which allows it to recharge while you continue to read. The power button and charge port are located in the upper top-right corner, more or less opposite from where they are on the Paperwhite. I find this location to be less awkward, as it\\'s easier to reach on the top than it is on the bottom edge. The back surface of the reader (not the case) seems to easily attract fingerprints, and they are not so easy to clean off. You\\'d think that Amazon would have figured out a way to prevent this by now. It\\'s a minor annoyance. Lots of reviewers in the tech press have complained loudly about this model\\'s high price relative to other Kindle models (without ads, it\\'s $310 vs. $139 for an ad-less Paperwhite). Is this a lot of money? Perhaps, but if you are a book addict and value an extremely lightweight reader that\\'s easy on both your arms and your eyes, then I personally think it\\'s worth it. A lot of thought and effort clearly went into designing and building this unit, and the price reflects that. Is it for everyone? Probably not, but there is obviously a market for it when you consider how many months you\\'ll have to wait to get one on Amazon\\'s website. If you are a serious reader, this device deserves a very close look -- I\\'m definitely keeping mine! I got oasis yesterday, very lighweight compared to voyager, screen size comparable, like having actual page turn button, touchscreen seems kinda slow, the on/off button on top is improvement from back of voyager. cover does seem kind of flimsy, but supposed to be leather so will see how it holds up. finding it easier to hold with cover on, then removed. cover doesn\\'t have separate charge port, so all charging is done thru kindle. BestBuy delivered this on the day of release. Amazon still seems to be back-ordered. It is a great product. Nice and light with uniform screen and snappy performance. Got this for my wife and she loves it. Compact library on the go for an avid reader. Kindle Oasis is phenomenal... It is portable size so it fits almost anywhere when I travel, the book-like screen doesn\\'t bother my eyes after long periods of time of reading, I can modify the font and size to my wants and needs, you can conveniently connect to your Goodreads account to view your bookshelves and all of my purchases sync perfectly. The color Merlot is beautiful and I\\'ve had it for three months and traveled with it and there have been no damages. The battery life is so long I have only charged it three times since owning it and I read anywhere from 3-5 hours a day. Completely user friendly. Small, light, but comfortable to hold with either hand. If you keep it in airplane mode with medium lighting, the battery last for weeks. Lovin\\' it so far. Would give it a 5 star if the battery lasted as long as they claim. But it\\'s worth the extra charging times for the nice design. So light and easy in your hand especially without the cover. But, using the cover is comfortable as well. The leather cover smells a bit when it arrives but I let it air out for a few days before using it and now it\\'s fine. Nice quality leather and I love the merlot color. The page turn buttons are easier to use than the buttons on the voyage. Screen looks the same even though they claim there are more backlights on this one. I\\'m very happy with my Oasis. Almost feels like reading a book in a light comforting way. Easy to carry around. Great on eyes and reading is enjoyable When they first announced the Kindle Oasis, I did not have much of a desire to upgrade from my 1st generation Kindle Paperwhite. Just as I felt when they announced the Voyage.I read a lot, so my Kindle travels with me throughout the day most of the time. I have never had an issue with battery life, I have only had it get really low a few times (typically when I was traveling). So again, I originally did not see a lot of the value to the Oasis.As the reviews for the Oasis came out, I started to realize what I did not like about my Paperwhite, and I began to have an interest in upgrading my Paperwhite to the either the Oasis or possibly the Voyage. The main thing I noticed is that I took my Paperwhite out of the Amazon case quite a lot, especially when I was in a seated position. This slight reduction in weight made it much more comfortable to hold for longer reading sessions. I had some other minor issues with my Paperwhite, like when reading in the dark, I couldn\\'t find an adjustment for the light that I preferred (5 was a little too dim and 6 was a brighter than I needed). I decided to pass on the Voyage because I really did not like the case options and the pressure sensitive page turn option.Now that I have the Oasis, I definitely think it was worth it for me. I really appreciate the reduced weight when the cover is off (not to mention the ease of removing the cover compared to the Paperwhite). It provides the same reading experience, although I did get a resolution upgrade compared to my older Paperwhite, which is a plus.The Oasis is really comfortable in my hand, which helps me forget that it is there. When I was holding my Paperwhite with my left hand, at times I would accidentally go back a page, which drove me crazy even though its just a minor inconvenience.I have the black model because it was the only option available unless I was willing to wait a few more months. The build quality of the Oasis and its case is very nice, just like with the Paperwhite and the amazon leather case for it. The only concern I have is how well it will protect the Kindle. I will update the review if I find this to be a problem.I loved my Paperwhite, and I will recommend it to anyone looking to upgrade from an older Kindle or buying one for the first time. It definitely is great and the better buy, but I am glad I decided to order the Oasis. The reduced weight, ergonomic design, and page turn buttons make it worth the added cost. I bought 2 and am returning them both. Both had lighting issues. On the first one, one half of the screen had a white/blue tint and the other half was more of a yellow tint. When i flipped the device upside down to rotate to use with my other hand, half of the screen went much darker than the other. I returned it because I had read there were some that had lighting issues and bought another one. My second one was worse. You could see little half moons going down one side. That one also had a much yellower tint overall than the first one.I found it not easy to hold unless it was in the charging case. It was too slippery and, weird to say, small for me. I\\'m a female with average sized hands.I think what I really did love was the charging case and the size for transport purposes. Maybe when they make a few tweaks and lower the price I might try again. With the cover attached, the battery lasts for a good, long period. With the cover detached (which is how I use it primarily), the Oasis is so thin that it is almost weightless in your hand. The ability to switch hands (flip upside down) means one never seems to tire of holding the device to read a book; and, it fits into my pants pocket, again, perfect for traveling. The battery seems to last with heavy usage for at least several days, but I tend to reconnect the cover at night (I am assuming that helps to recharge the basic Oasis battery). Regardless, it was well worth replacing our older Kindle readers with the newer Oasis (we bought two). Easy to carry in purse or pocket but doesn\\'t do anything better than the cheapest Kindle reader. I debated buying the new Kindle Oasis, since I\\'ve owned every Kindle since the first release. It was worth the money, as the form factor is the best yet... it\\'s comfortable to hold in one hand, and the text is crisp and easy to read. Even when I’m outside in bright sunlight, the words of the book I’m reading are still crystal clear. That alone makes the Kindle Oasis worth what it cost me.The Kindle Oasis wakes up in just seconds, and any book I choose instantly opens, ready to be read.It is the perfect size and isn’t heavy or bulky. I really do read for hours at a time. Sometimes I pace the floor while I read. Sometimes I’m on my elliptical machine when I read. And sometimes I’m sitting down. No matter what I’m doing, the Kindle Oasis remains comfortable to hold, and it is always easy on my eyes.When I receive a book that is in PDF, most of the time I can enlarge the words. If it won’t allow me to enlarge the words, I can change the orientation of the page and the words are automatically larger. I am able to make notes on the book if needed, and I can highlight words and/or passages.My merlot leather cover is attractive. When I flip it open, it is just like opening the cover of a book.How to Make the Battery LastOn the Kindle Oasis page, it says that its “dual-battery charging system delivers months of battery life.” This was a huge thing for me. Instead of having to charge my tablet almost every day, I would be able to read for months without charging the Kindle!Is this how my Oasis has performed? Well, not so much. There are conditions that have to be met for the charge on your Oasis to last for two months.First, you have to limit your reading to thirty minutes a day. That one is impossible for me. There are days that I am only able to read for thirty minutes, but they don’t occur very often. My Kindle goes everywhere with me, and I use just about every spare moment to read.Second, the wireless needs to be turned off. That one is easy to do but not always easy to remember. The only time the wireless needs to be on is to download one or more books.Third, this is based on your light setting at 10. That is way too low for me. I keep my light setting anywhere from 16 to 18.I don’t limit my reading to thirty minutes a day, and I try to remember to keep my wireless turned off. My light setting is kept anywhere from 16 to 18, and I put my Kindle to sleep the second I’m done reading. So how long does a single charge last me? Ten days is the longest a charge has lasted me so far, but it would have kept a charge for several more days if I had remembered to turn my wireless off. Once I succeed in keeping my wireless off, I will let you know how long the charge lasts.Now, I don’t plug it in to charge as soon as the charge on the cover gets low. I allow my cover charge to go as low as it will possibly go and then the Kindle battery will start to drain since it can no longer charge from the cover. I allow it to drain down to about 50% before I plug the cover and Kindle into my computer to charge.The one thing that surprised me was that everything on the Oasis is in black and white. For some reason, I thought that maybe the book covers would appear in color. But since I bought the Oasis to read books on, color isn’t needed.Special offers do appear on my screen but only when my Kindle is going to sleep or waking up. They aren’t a distraction, and to be honest, they are kind of fun to look at. You can pay a higher price so they won’t appear on your Kindle if you would rather not see them.I asked myself some questions once I had my Kindle and knew just how it worked. If I had known before I bought my Kindle Oasis that the charge wouldn’t last for months, would I still have bought it? Yes, I would have. If I had known that everything would appear in black and white, would I still have bought it? Yes, I would have. Easy to handle. Light weight. I like that it automatically shuts off when the cover is closed. Bought for my wife to upgrade from the original Kindle that she has worn out. Big step up from the original and should be good for another 8-10 years. I love the snap on cover that charges the kindle. It is also very light. Wife love it, reads a lot and this is her go to reader. This is my third Kindle. The best differentiator is the form factor. Definite improvement over the paperwhite. Also like having the page-turn buttons back. Case is very cool indeed. If you can get past the jump in price (remember you\\'re not having to buy the case separately), it\\'s a quality product to have. I was so looking forward to this that I bought it right when it popped up as available on Best Buy. This is obviously the most refined Kindle on the market as of now. The ergonomics are just perfect, as there is no other Kindle or any ebook reader for that matter that is as easy to use single handed as this one. Fits perfectly in the palm and the page turn buttons are a joy to use.The charging case can be removed while reading and it snaps back easily, you do not have to deliberately align it properly. Once the case is connected it starts charging the Kindle which prolongs its battery life.In short, if you are an avid reader and can spare $290, this is the Kindle to buy. For occasional readers it might not make sense to spend so much and the Kindle Paperwhite should do just fine. I have used Kindle e-readers since Amazon introduced them years ago. All are good products and each new model has been a worthwhile upgrade. The Oasis is no exception, even from the highly touted Voyage model. It is expensive but the lightweight design, improved backlighting and battery cover are worth the additional expense for someone who reads frequently. This is definitely a good investment! This is my 4th kindle and is easily the best one I\\'ve ever had. It is very comfortable to hold and is very compact. I was surprised how small it is but has the same screen size as my other kindles. It may look costly at first but remember you are getting a cover with additional battery. This is the best kindle ereader yet. The size and weight make it perfect for comfortable reading. You will find yourself reading more books than ever with it. Actually easier to hold than a paperback, and might even be lighter! Finally received the Kindle Lighted Leather Cover for the newest version Kindle. It is VERY lightweight and I had to double and triple check the description considering it states this is a leather cover. The front cover is very thin with a medium-weight cardboard feel to it. The leather on the front cover is extremely thin and you can immediately tell the surface will be easily scratched and marred with normal everyday use. The inside of the front cover has a thin microfiber material to protect the screen. The back cover is hollowed out plastic to form-fit your Kindle and snaps in with relative ease.Using the enclosed graphic instruction card, I removed the Kindle as shown, having to use just enough pressure to make me a bit concerned for someone who would place and remove their Kindle in this cover frequently. However, I plan on using this cover as a full-time solution for both protection and as a light source.I went ahead and pulled up a book and switched the light on, heading to a closet to see how this looked in complete darkness. The light pulls out of the back cover and is nice and stiff and has a locked full-out position. The spread of the light is greater on top obviously but it does reach the entire screen on the Kindle. There was no glare or reflection and I was able to easily read the page without any noticeable straining.If I were to choose between this design and the Kindle Keyboard lighted cover, which I have used since its release, I would choose this newer cover.Read more I owned a Kindle Keyboard for about a year, and I purchased the leather lighted case for that unit. While the corner light left a little to be desired as far as even lighting, overall I was very pleased with the case. Based on that experience, I went ahead and purchased the lighted cover for my new Kindle. I can\\'t say this experience has as been as positive.Let\\'s start off with what\\'s good about the case. The Kindle battery powered light is a big improvement. The light is now centered on the screen, so illumination is more even now. I don\\'t use the light often, but in the cases where I do it will be nice to have more balanced coverage. One positive on the case itself is that I appreciate how much lighter this one feels than the previous generation. The hinge area is smaller, which means less of the spine folding effect the other one took on after heavy use. I never took my Kindle Keyboard out of the case after it was put in, so the snug fit I have seen complaints about is not an issue for me. It IS tight, though, so if you don\\'t plan to keep the case on full time be aware it may take some effort to get it back out. In my situation, that tight fit is exactly what I want, but your mileage may vary.Now on to the negatives. The case does feel very cheap, especially with no change in price point. The previous cover felt like a solidly made piece of work, whereas the new cover only feels half as sturdy. The thinness of the case was no doubt done to minimize its weight, so I realize this is a personal issue. Outside the thickness, though, it just doesn\\'t look or feel as well made. The textured surface of the previous model you that leather feel, very much like a real book. Finally, the most stunning oversight is the lack of a closure device.Read more I purchased this Kindle case in the Saddle Tan color. The leather is high quality (it has that wonderful new smell as well) and has beautiful stitching around the border on the front. The case does not add any bulk to the Kindle. I find it quite comfortable to hold in one hand or two, as the front cover folds behind the case, and I truly feel like I am holding an actual book while reading.At the top of the case, there is a plastic arm that pulls upward to reveal a light, which illuminates the screen of the Kindle perfectly in a dark room. My eyes have no trouble reading with the light activated. The light is powered by the Kindle itself, by way of two metal prongs inside the case making contact with two metal tabs on the lower back of the Kindle. The arm for the light does seem a bit delicate, and I could see a young child inadvertently breaking this if care is not shown. I fear that over time, this will be the first piece to stop functioning as the case is regularly used.My only criticism of this case is that there is no way to secure the front cover from opening. It would have been nice to include a clasp, or some kind of stretchable band to keep the case closed. I paid 54 for this case, which is almost as expensive as the Kindle itself. At that price, the designers should have had the forethought to include a means of securing the case from opening. Aside from this potential problem, this Kindle case is perfect, and adds a bit of sophistication to an already awesome device.Kudos, Amazon! I have had the Kindle Keyboard with it\\'s lighted cover and now I have the new Kindle with lighted cover. I will briefly compare them and then list the pros and cons of this cover.In comparison:-The kindle keyboard in the cover is much heavier than the new kindle in it\\'s cover. The new case does a much better job of securing the kindle as well, it is no longer hinged only on one edge, but instead it is form fit inside of a rigid rubber shell that attaches to the back of the new kindle-The lighting is about the same between both cases, but where the old case lit the screen from the top right corner, the new case lights the screen from the top middle.-I feel like the old light mechanism was more durable. The light bar on this cover is made out of very stiff, thin plastic instead of the thick rubbery plastic that contained the light on the old cover. It also hinges open instead of pulling out of the case, and the hinge feels subpar.-The light on the new case is less angled and tends to get in my eyes more when reading than the old kindle keyboard case did.All in all I still like the new case. It fits the new kindle very well and does not increase the size or weight very much. The leather is somewhat thin but not horribly so and it looks sleek on the kindle. I will be keeping this case.Pros:Compact case that looks very sleekTight and secure fitUses the Kindle\\'s batteries so no additional power is needed.Provides adequate lighting across the entire screen.Cons:Lightbar hinge seems very cheap.Since I only received this today, I cannot yet evaluate the additional drain that this case will place on the Kindle\\'s battery.Read more I read every single review for this cover before I decided to buy it, but I am glad that I finally decided to pull the trigger. I have never had a Kindle or another cover, so my review is based on a first-timer\\'s perspective. This is my feedback:1) I agree that this cover is expensive. Ridiculously expensive. But, after pricing other covers and other lights, then factoring in that I would have to buy replacement batteries for any other light, it did not seem like I would be saving much money if I bought something else. Plus, the fact that the light is built-in was very appealing and turns out to be extremely convenient.2) Yes, the cover should have had a magnet or something for closure. That was the main reason for my initial hesitation, not the price. I thought about using a rubber band around it, but some people mentioned that a rubber band would look ugly around the pretty cover (which, by the way, is quite pretty in the wine purple color). I ended up knitting a small little sleeve to slip over my Kindle cover to keep the cover closed, for additional protection, and to prevent scratches, because:3) The cover does scratch quite easily. I agree with one reviewer who did not seem to mind the scratches on the cover, because doesn\\'t that show that the cover is doing its job to protect the Kindle But, it does sound like the same cover for the Kindle Keyboard was much more durable. It would be nice for the cover to keep looking fresh and new, but I would rather my Kindle be protected than for my cover to look perfect. My little knitted sleeve is helping with that, but I know a lot of people wouldn\\'t want to use an additional cover.4) Some people commented that the cover added too much to the size and weight of the Kindle. ReallyRead more The Kindle is my first e-ink reader. I own an iPad, an iPhone, and have owned a Windows-based phone in the past that I used as an ereader.My overall impression of the device is good.The good:I\\'d honestly rather read linear (read from page one to the end, one page at a time) fiction from it than a book, because I can\\'t always get comfortable with a book. Hardcovers are sometimes a bit heavy, and paperbacks don\\'t always lie open easily. The Kindle is incredibly light and thin. I can hold it in one hand easily. The page turn buttons are conveniently located.

There are newer models: the basic, cheapie Kindle and the Kindle Touch, and of course the Kindle Fire quasi-tablet.Each of these models is an excellent choice. Whichever one is right for you just depends on your preferences.The 3 e-ink Kindles are Kindle Keyboard (this one), Kindle Touch (the newest flagship model), and the basic Kindle. All 3 of them have EXACTLY THE SAME 6 DISPLAY, with the same sharp typeface and high contrast that reads like ink on paper with no eyestrain. The Kindle Keyboard is the oldest of these models, and I got one of the first ones when they came out in August 2010.I still absolutely LOVE my Kindle Keyboard and use it almost every day. I have read dozens of books on it. I like the newer models, they have some neat features, but the experience of reading a book on them is no better or worse than on my 1-year-old Kindle Keyboard. Page turns are now smoother and faster on the newest Kindles, but the difference is not enough to make it worth the cost of upgrading, in my opinion.The touch-screen interface of the Kindle Touch is pretty neat. But, unlike my iPad, I only use my Kindle to read books, and reading books is just as nice on any of the current Kindle models. I don\\'t consider the touch screen a must have feature, and I\\'m normally obsessed with having the latest version of every tech product I own.For that reason, I think the cheapest Kindle is an excellent choice.Read more I\\'m a first-time Kindle owner, so I have nothing to compare the latest Kindle to.

I have an iPad and a Kindle DX, but I guess someone heard my complaints of them being too heavy and difficult to do extended-reading on. Don\\'t get me wrong, I absolutely love my iPad and DX, but this new generation of Kindle is perfect for reading outside and for long periods of time. The iPad gets completely washed out in sunlight and often irritates my eyes staring at it for more than a couple of hours. The DX was my go-to device for those extended/outdoor reading periods, but now I have a new friend for reading novels. Instead of a replacement, this one seems more like a companion to the other devices and is a different class. The iPad works great for web browsing, shopping, productivity, games, etc while the Kindle falls short in those areas. The Kindle works great for reading novels, where the iPad falls short.

It\\'s smaller than the last edition by a significant margin. I\\'ve played around with the Kindle 2 and was impressed, but now looking at the size of the new Kindle, I\\'m blown away. It\\'s the absolute perfect size. Smaller would be unmanageable and larger wouldn\\'t feel nearly as good. This is a device that you can hold up, read, and just forget that it\\'s there.

All of them quit working. There\\'s absolutely no way to revive them once that battery loses power If NOT charged immediately, if even just a few weeks go by, NO HOPE of ever using your Kindle again. A major flaw I recently ordered my 8th Kindle. It was to replace my 7th Kindle which I unknowingly crushed. I love the Kindle Keyboard as my clumsy old hands tremble too much to type on a touch screen. For me, newer is just more frustrating. However, new Keyboard Kindles are scarce on the ground, so I got a reconditioned one. I noticed on my account page that Amazon recognized my new Kindle as soon as I bought it. When it arrived, however, it was not registered to me and it claimed it could not connect to my home WiFi. So I called my internet provider. I waded through that companys automated menu beginning with press 1 for English. That irritates me as I think English should be the default language in this country. But pressing on, I provided my 9 digit phone number, my 10 digit account number, my 9 digit zip code, my address, my 8 digit birthday, and the name of my favorite pet, my first car and my oldest nephew. Then I listened to an automated menu that had a 9 item selection none of which exactly fitted the problem I was having. After all this, I was asked if I would provide feedback after the call. I know this company and I was sure I would have comments to make, so I pressed 1 for yes. Then instead of finally letting me speak to a person, the automated voice directed me back through the forest of numbers I had already provided. Patiently I retyped all I had already typed. This time I was cannier. I refused the opportunity to give feedback and was finally connected to a person a person with a strong foreign accent and a bad phone connection. Didnt I press 1 for English After struggling for several minutes I begged for a supervisor as I could not understand the English spoken by this person. I was eventually routed to three other people with a hold time between each new connection as each person I spoke to did not handle my problem. I asked for phone numbers every time so I could reconnect if my call was disconnected accidentally. Finally I found a person who could help and did indeed get a connection established between my Kindle and my WiFi. I again asked for a telephone number in case I had further problems. Im sorry. I do not have a phone number that you can call to connect directly to me. Well, I should have known. I had been on the phone for 50 minutes.Then my Kindle would not download my archived items. So I contacted Amazons Help Line. I got an American in the first minute. I did not have to press anything I explained my problem. The Amazon American fiddled with a few buttons on his end and my Kindle began working correctly. I was on the phone for 4 minutes. Great. Love it. I researched the purchase of a Kindle for a long time. I couldn\\'t decide whether or not it was worth buying a dedicated e-reader. Boy am I glad I made this purchase. The downside to Amazon\\'s online selling of Kindle 3 is that the customers don\\'t get to see it in person. It is much better in person. This may sound stupid, but when I got my new Kindle, I thought there was a stuck-on overlay on the screen containing a diagram of the unit\\'s buttons, etc. I actually tried to peel it off. Doh! The e-ink on this unit is THAT good. I didn\\'t realize that I was staring at the actual display. I also didn\\'t realize that no power is required until the display changes. (thus the great battery life) I do a lot of reading, but was facing the prospect of reading less or buying large type books because of my variable and deteriorating eyesight. The new Kindle has been a godsend. Now, I can decide the size of type I need depending on my level of fatigue among other things. The weight and ergonomics are very good. For someone, like me, with neuropathy in his hands, it is extremely easy to manage and enjoyable to own. To me, it is easier to read than print books. The ease of navigation is great as is the speed. The battery life, so far, has been extraordinary. It easily connected to our home Wi-Fi, which by design does not broadcast an SSID. It downloads books so fast that I almost thought they were not completely received. I did not buy the 3G version because of the price difference and the fact that there is no coverage where I live. If you are not constantly traveling, I don\\'t see the need to spend the extra bucks, but that is a matter of personal choice. For those who have no Wi-Fi at home, remember that you can always download the material to your computer and transfer it via USB.Read more This thing has captured my wife\\'s heart. She reads every where, all the time. Vacation, on the way to church, At bedtime and far beyond. Books are so easy to get from the kindle itself It fits in her purse, I have to repeat everything , I always get, right after this chapter . Do not buy this for someone you want share LIFE with. I got my Kindle a few years ago and barely used it. Recently I discovered it again and have been using it daily, always in a hard protective case as it has been from day 1. Yesterday I opened the cover ready to read and discovered the screen had apparently cracked, seemingly for no apparent reason (no extreme temperatures, dropping, pressure, etc.). A quick Google search revealed this is a common problem, especially for my model, which made me think Amazon would replace the device for me due to the obvious design flaw. Not a chance though. Despite endless reports of this problem popping up through simple internet searches the representative I spoke to denied this was a common problem and was only able to offer me a very slight discount on a new product. Not sure it is worth the investment again - thinking it is better to stick to reading on my iPad, which is equipped with indestructible Gorilla Glass. Bottom line: do not buy a Kindle if you want a lasting product It was excellent for me in one moment when I was able to use it onboard cruise ship while ship was in international water with it\\'s own 3G or EDGE cellphone network. Once they stop this way of using around 5 months ago, now I can use it only when I am in the states. Bought for my husband for Christmas and I have to admit that I use it much more than he does, I love this product even though it has been updated with newer versions. I like to have something with just books. Easy to use, screen is easy to read, battery life long. I use it at the beach and for travel. Nice to have It simply works even after 3.5 years of constant use. The battery is OK. Display looks the same. System is stable and reasonably responsive. I would highly recommend them to everyone. Got it when I was told that I would get it. Very happy. Through all of my research this was the best value for what I was looking for in an e-reader with additional options I was not sure I would use or not. Turns I do because of the ease of usage. Pretty decent tablet. Good for mindless games and Netflix. You get what you pay for. Much more memory that my prior kindles. Luv that I can add a sd card for extra storage good quality, low cost compare to iPad, i like this. I was going to have to be face down after eye surgery recently and decided to get a tablet to be able to look at the internet and movies on something other than my phone. While there are ones which have more features (and better software), the Fire HD8 had a good price and was available. It had gotten good reviews, and it performs well, with great battery life. If you\\'re looking for a good, basic tablet, this is a nice option. I love the tablets HD picture is beautiful. The fire tablet is very fast to load and is easy to use. Great tablet. This is very nice for a little over 100.00 dollars. It took a bit to get use to after using a iPad. I got this to travel with or take to the beach nice size very lightweight. I couldn\\'t get the tablet to work with my WiFi so I returned it and bought a Samsung A-8. This tablet is small, compact and easy to handle. It\\'s easy to figure out the main functions. My one complaint is that it does not support some big apps such as Dropbox or Google Drive. I\\'m a Windows person & this is not Windows. I\\'m still learning. I am happy with the size as it fits easily in to my purse, but I HATE touch items - I always seem to touch the wrong area (like spelling something, I go for a letter & get one of the letters next to - so it slows down my typing - one of the reasons I don\\'t have a smartphone). All in all it\\'s pretty good. I guess I would recommend it because it\\'s the way this world is turning. However, they don\\'t make a glass protective screen cover - only plastic. Ordered for my daughter to replace an older version and she loves it. Larger screen and colored case are a big plus. I have not set up tablet, geeks squad to do so Monday April 3 2017 Have been using this for a while and never believe it would be so handy and helpful. Product features are good and is quite handy to carry anywhere. I love the internet, tweeting and facebook. No computers can complete me!! My kindle takes care of all my needs ;) !!!Juju I like it. It keeps my granddaughter business and great apps too. She loves it, the only problem I have is getting it away from her, even while riding in vehicles. LOL I bought this because I have ebooks in college. Not only could I not get my ebook. I called the school IT department. They could not either. My semester was already started. The sales representative at the store told me this is what I needed. I ended up buying a tablet from my phone carrier and my ebooks were right there in less than 5 minutes with the schools IT department help. Wife really likes it. Works great& likes the front & back camera. I bought this kindle for my 11yr old granddaughter for Christmas. Me and my husband both had kindles several years prior, and she and my 6 year old grandson love watching and playing on them. Both children have all kinds of game systems but use the kindle way more. My 6 yr old grandson still plays with mine and loves watching you tube, videos and playing games on it. He has several game systems, Xbox, sega, ds but still uses my kindle all the time over those systems.my husband used his all the time for everything from internet to watching movies and shows. I\\'m getting ready to buy my grandson a new kindle( mine is a bit older and has cracked screen now but still works good).He would like one to call his own. I\\'m looking at a 16 GB or 32 GB.they are really durable and tough. This is my first Fire Kindle. I love it. It is fast, and has good internet. It gives me quick access to all my Kindle library. I found out it\\'s easier to scroll through the pages than when using Kindle Touch. Fast on internet, easy connection. Easy to use. Clear display. Was looking at iPad mini. After reading reviews of both Kindle fire and iPad I bought the Kindle for so much less $$$ And I don\\'t have to put up the Apple\\'s native apps etc. Thanks. We really like this tablet . It\\'s easy to use All I wanted was a Kindle to read books. I got this instead!! Excellent choice because I can read books and do so much more!! I had to return this product as it was not compatible with things such as Facebook and Itunes... which is what I needed it for. Great if you are into books and streaming movies! Love this Kindle. There are to many apps and games offered for download. Love the book selection Easy to navigate The charger seems a bit loose, though I like the ease of use and good support from Amazon. A reasonable price for a versatile tablet. This tablet is excellent considering the price. It has a very clear display, is a fairly large tablet, and has plenty of memory to store a lot of apps, music, pictures and more. Considering the price, this tablet has the best value out of all tablets to date in my opinion. I\\'ve had lots of tablets in the past, mostly from the Samsung line, but this is my first Amazon Fire, so I want to write this review for others who have never tried one of these. At the time that this was written, Alexa had not been added to the tablet.First, while this device runs an Android type of operating system, Amazon puts its own spin on the operating system. I don\\'t feel like I\\'m using Android. This feels different to me. It doesn\\'t have the same level of customization that Android users have come to appreciate. That being said, if you are an Amazon Prime member, this device has been tailored to be your content entertainment machine. It\\'s simply a fun way to consume your magazines, books, etc.There are 3 on-screen buttons on the bottom of the device. The middle button immediately takes you to your home screen. The button to the left acts as a sort of \"back\" button. It also lets me get rid of my keyboard when I don\\'t need it on screen, but it\\'s open. The button to the right is super important. It took me a couple of days to realize what it does. That square shaped button is what you press you see what apps you have open. It lets you switch between apps, but it also lets you see which apps you have open and close them out. You can close them by pressing the \"X\" button in the corner of the window that appears or by touching the app window and swiping to the right. If you leave all of those apps open and you never close them, you\\'ll drain your battery. Make sure you use that little square button to clear your apps.The device has several menus that you swipe left to view. First, you start with your home screen. You literally can stay on this screen and do anything you need to do on the tablet. All of your apps are housed here. You swipe up to view all of them. The tablet comes with several apps pre-installed such as Slik, Amazon\\'s own internet browser, Audible, Good Reads, the Amazon app store, a weather app, etc. You can go to the Amazon app store to download other apps such as Twitter, Facebook, etc. You can combine the apps on this page into folders. You just drag one app to another app and a folder appears. This made my home screen much more manageable. You can change the size of the font on the home screen from normal to large or small in the device settings. This feature doesn\\'t necessarily increase the size of the font within your apps, however. I believe it only changes the font on your main screens.If you have a magazine or newspaper subscription that is connected to your device, when you have a new issues, it will show up at the top of your home page screen under the heading of \"new items.\" The device comes with a free 6 month subscription to the Washington Post. You\\'ll see that under \"new items\" when you initially activate your tablet.You can change the wallpaper on the screen to use one of your own photos. You can do this through the settings menu on the device. If you want to use one of your own photos, however, you need to either take it on the device or move it into Amazon\\'s Photos app, which is a cloud-based app.So far, I haven\\'t found a way to effectively use a different photo management app that will let me change my wallpaper. I\\'m not crazy about the Amazon Photo app. I found it annoying to move my photos from my phone into Amazon\\'s cloud just so I could view them on my tablet. That being said, I\\'m not planning to take photos on this device. I just wanted a few pet photos on there and the ability to change my wallpaper.Beyond the home screen, you can swipe to the right to view your other screen. They are pre-arranged to be: books, videos, games, shop, apps, music, audiobooks, and newstand. All of those screens are connected to your Amazon account. For example, if you have Kindle books you\\'ve already purchased, they automatically will appear under the Books menu. Your magazines and newspaper subscriptions will appear under the newstand menu. There doesn\\'t seem to be a way to change the order of the menu pages. That bugs me, but it\\'s not the end of the world. There\\'s also one menu to the left of the \"home\" menu. It\\'s the \"recent\" page. It shows you what you\\'ve received looked at on the tablet. I never use it, but it might be handy for some people.One of my favorite features of this tablet is Amazon\\'s \"On Deck\" capability. If you\\'re an Amazon Prime member, Amazon will periodically download a video to your device that it thinks you might like. The items don\\'t count against your pre-installed memory and they automatically deleted off if your memory starts getting full. You can turn off the \"on deck\" feature if you don\\'t like it. I\\'ve been content with the video playback capability. This isn\\'t my major use of the device, but the images look fine and the audio is OK. I\\'ll talk more about the speakers later. My other favorite feature of this tablet is viewing magazine content through the Newstand. I\\'ve tried 3 magazines on here and they all look gorgeous. Now, I can always have my magazines with me so if I\\'m stuck at the airport or at the doctor\\'s office, I always have them. One of my regular magazines includes a free digital version of the magazine for free. I just had to connect my account to the device. This allows me to download the back issues of the magazine for as long as I\\'ve had an account. My other magazine didn\\'t include a digital edition so I canceled the print edition of it and switched to the digital version. (It was an inexpensive magazine, anyway.) There are several magazines that you can try free for 30 days on the device. I did this with a third magazine and decided to keep it for a year. Viewing magazines on this gadget is a pleasure.The Kindle Fire doesn\\'t come with the Google Play store installed. You can side load it to the device without rooting it (and breaking your warranty.) You can Google to find the instructions to do this. It\\'s not difficult to do if you\\'re fairly comfortable with technology. It probably took me 10 minutes. Most of the apps I wanted were in the Amazon store, but there were a handful that I had paid for through Google Play. The only way I could have them was to go back to access that store. They have worked fine so far. I despise the keyboard that Amazon pre-installed on this device. There are no lines between the letters on the keyboard. I suppose it designed to be better for swyping through keys, but I hate it. I fixed that problem by going to Google Play and downloading a new keyboard. It was a pretty easy problem to solve so I can\\'t complain.Apps that are connecting to the Internet can be a little slow to load on this device compared to my other gadgets, but that generally doesn\\'t bother me. If you were using this tablet to replace your personal laptop, however, that might drive you crazy. The screen on this device isn\\'t bad. If I compare it to my fancy phone, it\\'s not as shape, but when you think about the price of this device compared to my smartphone, the screen is outstanding.The speakers are OK. There are two of them located on the bottom of the screen. I won\\'t say that they are fantastic. They aren\\'t. In my opinion, they are fine for watching YouTube or a television show. They are not OK for listening to music if you are an audiophile. You can make it a little better by downloading a different music app instead of relying on the pre-install app, but still your music will sound tinny. That being said, you can always connect your tablet to a bluetooth speaker, use a pair of headphones, etc.This device wasn\\'t made for taking pictures. It has a front and back camera, but they aren\\'t designed to be spectacular. I\\'m not using them.I find this device a little difficult to hold in my hands. I think that\\'s partly because of the size and partly because it feels very slick. Also, I do have some hand problems (similar to someone who has Carpal Tunnel syndrome). I think it will be easier to handle once my case arrives. I\\'m still waiting for it. I\\'m greatly enjoying this device. It\\'s simply fun to use the tablet. There are weaknesses that come with that lower price tag, but you legitimately get a lot of bang for your buck, particularly if you regularly use Amazon services. If you don\\'t typically use Amazon and you are just looking for a tablet for viewing the Internet and you\\'re looking for a low price tag, this device may be OK for you. I bought this to replace a damaged much more expensive tablet of my daughters. Great item and just as nice as the more expensive one. She absolutely loves it. Fantastic tablet fire one is great. Small and portable I purchased this product with an eye on simply trying out a tablet. It has become a product I use every day. You have to get used to the Amazon app store, which is different than the Google Play store, though it is still android-based. The tablet is fast and the user experience is satisfying. I purchased the 32Gb. model for the extra storage space. It is a great tablet for under $100! Decent little tablet if you are not a game player. Tablet shuts down and I cant get it back on when I play games for long periods of time. It\\'s not my ipad, that\\'s for sure. Does a lot more than old tablet.It Hasmore memory. Excellent value, lets me lug all my favorite books around and read whenever. Wouldn\\'t be without it. I love my Amazon Fire HD 8. It\\'s not too small and not too big. I was looking at other tablets, and decided on the Amazon Fire HD 8 because of the price, and because I have Amazon Prime, I purchased it online at Best Buy, and then picked it up at the store on Black Friday. It is my first tablet, and so I wanted to start with one that I can have fun with, and I am. I do have a laptop for important things. I have put off buying a tablet because all the ipads I tried with friends were hypersensitive making it difficult for me to navigate easily. This one is the bomb - I am 68 and not a techie but quite intelligent - this Kindle Fire is a perfect fit for me and does everything I want it to do and more with great speed and wonderful resolution. I am new at tablets and look forward to enjoying learning all that this Kindle Fire will provide for me - so far each step has been a breeze. I just love it. my daughter just loved this kindle fire. she said it was the perfect gift that she could receive. I love my kindle fire. Its a great reading device. Easy to set up, great picture love it! Keeps my kids entertained and they love it also ....it was a gift. The last 2 models of Kindle HDX 8 have been terrible. We have purchased 2 of each model of Kindle and up until the last 2 models, they have been great. Last years had to be replaced 7 or 8 times and for the same problem. The slot for the SD card is defective. I gave up and bought the newest model. It shuts completely down if you try to plug it in to external speakers and sometimes it shuts down for no reason. It\\'s going back after the first of the year. This is going to be my last year for Kindles unless they make them the same quality as before. Phooey! Easy to use with great picture. I would recommend it to a friend. This product was purchased for my Grandson. He had a fire 6. He however loves the HD 8. He uses it for music & gaming mostly. Great electronic device. This works great. I read a LOT and I needed something that would handle all my eBooks. It has all the other bells and whistles as any tablet but I use it for the eBooks and one game. Excellent! So far the tablet has been working without any issues. Haven\\'t used it enough to rate it any higher but time will tell. This is the right device to play with puzzles, you can avoid samsung/verizon constant advertisements. Only wish the battery would last longer or charge faster. My Fire is compact and easy to use. Mainly used to read online books at lunch time. The battery lasts much longer than previous tablet I had and charges much quicker. very happy with my Fire. Used it for watching television shows. The picture was clear and the audio was decent for the location of the speakers. great kid friendly product, hours of enjoyment for all. Only negative is the apps. Thought they were from android but they\\'re an Amazon version and limited. I have really enjoyed my new kindle and the ability to take pictures. It stays charged a long time when I am reading a book or watching a movie. I just wish that kindles could run on an LTE network as well when you do not have a WiFi signal. The clarity of the screen and the back-lit text makes this an improvement from my old tablet. I now can read this in low light and enjoy the color as well. I am enjoying my new Kindle, but it did present some challenges in its set up. I would recommend getting help in the store to get you started. I have had this for several weeks. It works great. I am very satisfied with it so far. This is my 3rd Kindle upgrade. I love everything about it. The ebooks read to me at night, the games and the movies show extremely well...feels as though I am right there. My kids have ipads...but I\\'m stuck on my Kindle. Never without my Amazon HD 8 - great for reading, games and surfing the networks. Awesome and best e-book reader. I love the smooth page translations, bedtime shade and perfect hand held device. Kindle Fire has took their e reader to the next level. Great apps, music, and storage expansion for the price. Bought this for a work fundraiser and the recipient enjoyed it I think this is a great product and I would recommend it. it was a good deal for this unit. they even beat amazon.... Bought it for the grandkids for Christmas. Like the parental controls! Haven\\'t had this long but so far so good. It\\'s nice when you buy a product and it works exactly how it is supposed to. I bought this for a daughter, who would be taking this to school for BYOD. It\\'s perfect size table offers, loads of amazon goodies if you are prime member. For our need, it was good enough, but one of the requirement was to have Google App support on this. Since this runs Fire OS, it\\'s everything Amazon proprietary. There as \"howto\" on web on getting google play store and its app on this, but the integration with the device lacks upon those \"fixes\" from the articles on how to get Google app store working on this tablet. Since it would not be useful for her in school because of requirements for Google apps, we\\'re returning it. Otherwise, Great tablet, but Fire OS restricts Google Apps. Bought this for my adult son who had a long flight and he absolutely loved it! Definitely recommend! So easy to use and navigate. Easy easy Amazon downloads from books to apps etc. I\\'m in the older generation that finds it hard to navigate electronics but not this tablet and Best Buy employees were great in helping me decide by giving a tutorial and info on the tablet . Fast, fluid, and lots of apps especially once I added the google play store(very simple to do and doesn\\'t require anything that voids the warranty). Display is sharp and video and games load quickly. I deducted one star as Amazon\\'s version of android lacks the ability of customization. For the price this is an excellent tablet. I have a high end laptop that does convert to tablet but at almost 16\" and the foldover design I normally just use it in laptop mode. I also have a high end \"phablet\" sized phone. So I was not sure how often I\\'d use a tablet, and did not want to spend 500ish on an ipad. The Fire has been a great \"in between\" so far on days I use my phone alot and want to avoid charging more than once per day, and don\\'t have the need to use my laptop. The speed is zippy & the screen clarity/quality is good enough. Storage is even better than ipads since it is expandable (for now I use a 64 gb card giving me a total of 96 gb, but the expandable can go up to 200 gb). Tying into Amazon is nice since I have Amazon Prime). Basic web surfing, email & facebook work great. The only \"bad\" feature is the camera & video quality. But that does not matter to me since I have my high quality camera & video recorder on my phone. Only other slight negative is light bleed noticed just when booting up on grey screen. Color/brightness uniformity is perfect to my eyes once it is up & running. Really enjoying the kindle component for book & magazine reading as well. Overall, probably the best $100 I have spent in a long time. Larger size more.memory, better price great product and wonderful service Many improvements than the older model with an excellent screen and great battery life. Great for all your tablet needs! Email, video, games, and reading! All in one!! My husband loves this. He is happy that he can read anything he chooses from his library and that he also has WiFi access to get to his email and the internet whenever he wants. I was literally still using my first gen Kindle Fire and finally upgraded. I love the new one. The only negative is the speakers. My first one is louder than this one. I have one, purchased this one for my mother in law, she had a 7 inch, between the bigger screen and HD, this one is much easier on her eyes and she can use it for longer periods of time without her eyes bothering her. But, I can\\'t figure out how to move books I\\'ve read, into the Cloud? I don\\'t like clutter, and the more I read and download, just clogs up. It\\'s great to some extent but I was expecting more. It\\'s unfortunate that it does not work with lots of apps. Perhaps I\\'m not using them correctly. I\\'m still learning. Bought as gift for my granddaughter who is 10. She loves it. Plays games, watches videos and listens to music. GREAT MEMORY,GREAT MOVIES,GREAT READING, GREAT GAMES,DO I HAVE TO SAY MORE This is the third Fire tablet I have bought. The larger size is nice. I don\\'t know much about tablets but the sales associate recommended this one for me. It does what I need and more but I just don\\'t know how to use it yet. I talk myself into the 32g and I am so glad I did!!! I have used only kindles for the past 5 years and I love them.... I love the color as well!!! The kindle over all is great. There\\'s only one thing I would want better and that is the speaker. My last kindle was louder. I really miss the louder speaker. I bought this as a Christmas gift for my wife and things started out well but lately my wife has been having issues with it. It hasn\\'t been working as it should and its only been a little over 2 months since she\\'s had it. I\\'m going to try a hard reset on it and see if that helps. Purchased this as a gift for my wife because her B&N Nook was dying. She absolutely loves it, especially since it does so much more. I\\'m now waiting for my Nook to start acting up so that I have an excuse to get a Kindle for myself. I would recommend anyone buy this product., just awesome. Love my new Kindle fire. This replaces my old one and is just as good. Videos are as good as my tv with cable. Well with every penny spent and better deal than when I tried Amazon. We replaced and aging fire HDX. She noticed the WiFi connection is improved and the screen is larger. She prefers this to my iPad Air Nice little tablet with great features. Bought one for my mom so she can read without all the weight of a big book. She also loves the nice backlight so she can be on her tablet at night without the lights on. Wanted something with a kids mode on it so we could limit time and content. This works. Saw it for a really low price so couldn\\'t resist otherwise we would have gotten the padded kids version. I was looking to upgrade from my old Kindle reader and stumbled on the Fire HD which is not only a reader but a tablet as well. Fairly easy to use. I really only needed to read books but how have a tablet as well. I wish it supported all google play apps and not just Amazon apps but I can check email and get to the web so it serves the purpose. But...when I want to read in the middle of the night, getting to the web can be distracting. In my opinion it\\'s very slow for internet use. Good for our 5 yr old to use but we purchased this for her to do online curriculums, which is almost impossible to do with this tablet because of the speed. Our internet connection is great with every other laptop and computer in the house. easy to use. nice sides and easy to read ,, also very easy to load Had a prob with original one I purchased and Bedt Buy replaced it hassle free I would recommend the Fire Tablet to anyone. IT is very easy to set up, download apps and use. Movies are crisp and clear. Bought this mostly as a backup.and to read a few books, since I have a larger cell phone and a back up. Used it occasionally may 40 or 50 hours of use till this week when I sent my laptop in for repairs. so I probably used it a tot this week. I was watching my 3rd Primetime video this week and it simply turned off. It will not turn on using any power trick such as safe mode. It is gone, It is toast. Bought it October 11, 2016 , It quit on February 9, 2015. My old Fire lasted 4 or 5 years with more use. it had stereo speakers, lasted a week on a charge not 2 or 3 days.Sturdier built. This is full of junk, I am not just offered more apps, it is constantly trying to add them. JUNK JUNK JUNK This is a very good tablet. The only con is you may have to reboot it too often. I hate amazon app store. Nothing good in there. The tablet is too slow for what I do... it is good for reading only.... This is my second Fire. Wanted a larger size to make eBooks easier to read. Very pleased with the size and clarity of this tablet. Easy to take along in a tote. Perfect for what I wanted it for.'"
